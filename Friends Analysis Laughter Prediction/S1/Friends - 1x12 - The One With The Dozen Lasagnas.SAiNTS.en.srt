1
00:00:57,123 --> 00:00:58,681
No, no, we're done!

2
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:03,388
The One With the Dozen Lasagnas

3
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:49,639
Aunt Silv, stop yelling!

4
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:52,778
If you'd told me
vegetarian lasagna...

5
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,447
... I would've made
vegetarian lasagna.

6
00:01:56,883 --> 00:02:00,580
The meat's only every third layer.
Maybe you could scrape.

7
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:04,513
Ross, did you really read
all these baby books?

8
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:08,820
You could plunk me down in
any woman's uterus, no compass...

9
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:12,256
...and I could find my way
out like that!

10
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:14,325
This is cool.

11
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:18,901
It says in some parts of the world
people eat the placenta.

12
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:22,902
And we're done with the yogurt.

13
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:25,668
Sorry.

14
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:29,679
I did this as a favor.
I am not a caterer.

15
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:33,352
What do you want me to do
with a dozen lasagnas?

16
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:36,317
Nice talk, Aunt Silv.

17
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,552
You kiss Uncle Freddie
with that mouth?

18
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:45,453
Ross, listen. Do you know that right
now your baby is only this big?

19
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,758
This is your baby.
" Hi, Daddy. "

20
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:49,290
Hello.

21
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:52,669
" How come you don't live with Mommy? "

22
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,368
" How come Mommy lives
with that other lady? "

23
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:04,242
"What's a lesbian? "

24
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:11,383
Honey, you can say it. Poconos.

25
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:16,119
Poconos. It's like " poke a nose. "

26
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:21,090
Poke a nose.

27
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:31,903
-So did I hear Poconos?
-Yes.

28
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:35,410
My sister's giving us her place
for the weekend.

29
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:37,344
First weekend together.

30
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,916
-It's a big step.
-I know.

31
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:45,314
-It's just a weekend. Big deal.
-Wasn't this supposed to be a fling?

32
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,149
Shouldn't it be...

33
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:49,256
...flung by now?

34
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:52,157
We are way past a "fling. "

35
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:56,392
I' m feeling things I've read about
in Danielle Steel books.

36
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:59,470
When l' m with him,
l' m just totally....

37
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,435
Nauseous.
I' m physically nauseous.

38
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:06,968
What am I supposed to do?
Call lmmigration?

39
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:09,678
I could call lmmigration.

40
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,119
What?

41
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,918
Ugly Naked Guy is making
shadow puppets.

42
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,695
Look, it's Abraham Lincoln.

43
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:26,597
Oh, right!

44
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:29,459
Go. Go!

45
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:38,336
I love babies with
their little baby shoes...

46
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:42,537
...and their little baby toes
and their little hands....

47
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:46,343
Okay, you' re gonna have to stop that.
Forever.

48
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:57,896
Need a new table.

49
00:04:58,598 --> 00:04:59,758
You think?

50
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:09,299
-Come on in.
-Hello.

51
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:11,042
I brought the books...

52
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:14,911
...and Monica sends her love
along with this lasagna.

53
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:19,278
Great! Is it vegetarian?
Because Susan doesn't eat meat.

54
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:23,551
I' m pretty sure that it is.

55
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:31,857
Nineteen weeks, the breasts
are starting to swell.

56
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:35,293
According to the literature.

57
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:39,198
-I got the results of the amnio.
-T ell me. Is everything...?

58
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:43,432
-T otally and completely healthy.
-That is great!

59
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:51,611
When did you and Susan
meet Huey Lewis?

60
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,876
That's our friend T anya.

61
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:05,894
Of course, it's your friend T anya.

62
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:11,998
-Don't you wanna know about the sex?
-The sex?

63
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:17,805
I' m having enough trouble with
the image of you and Susan together.

64
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,137
But when you throw in T anya....

65
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:25,483
The sex of the baby, Ross.

66
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,645
You know the sex of the baby?

67
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,489
-Want to know?
-No.

68
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,019
I don't want to. Absolutely not.

69
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,220
You shouldn't know until
you look down there...

70
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:40,432
...and see, " Oh, there it is. "

71
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,499
Or isn't.

72
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:47,738
-Hello, Ross.
-Susan.

73
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:48,963
So?

74
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:50,903
So did you hear?

75
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:53,270
Yes, we did.
Everything's A-Okay.

76
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:55,970
Oh, that's so cool!

77
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,647
It really is.

78
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,177
Do we know?

79
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:03,387
We certainly do.
It's going to be a

80
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:04,612
Hello?

81
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:08,453
A guy who doesn't wanna know
is standing here.

82
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:12,823
Well, is it what
we thought it would be?

83
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:21,097
What?

84
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,372
What did we think it'd be?

85
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,735
I don't wanna know.
Don't wanna know.

86
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:28,810
I should probably just go.

87
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:32,775
-Well, thanks for the books.
-No problem. Okay.

88
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:37,182
Susan.

89
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:47,065
Who should we call first?
Your folks or Deb and Rhona?

90
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:52,202
Hello?

91
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,470
Never mind.
I don 't wanna know.

92
00:07:57,543 --> 00:08:01,070
Because it was my table,
I have to buy a new one?

93
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,148
-That's the rule.
-What rule? There's no rule.

94
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:08,843
-You owe me a table.
-How did you get there?

95
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:14,083
It was fine until your breakfast
adventure with Angela Delvecio.

96
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,018
You knew about that?

97
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:20,529
The impressions in the butter
left little to the imagination.

98
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,235
How about if we split it?

99
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:27,230
-What do you mean, buy it together?
-Yeah.

100
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:31,769
-Do you think we' re ready for that?
-Why not?

101
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:35,937
It's a big commitment.
What if one of us wants to move out?

102
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:38,275
-You' re moving out?
-l' m not.

103
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:40,850
-You'd tell me if you were, right?
-Yes.

104
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:45,490
-It's just, with my last roommate
-I know all about Kip.

105
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:50,788
We bought a hibachi, then he ran off
and got married. Things got ugly.

106
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:55,661
Let me ask you something.
Was Kip a better roommate than me?

107
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:57,865
Oh, don't do that.

108
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:05,970
There's changes in your schedule.

109
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:09,272
Your 4:00 herbal massage is at 4:30.

110
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:12,541
And Miss Summerfield
canceled her 5:30 shiatsu.

111
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:13,977
Thanks.

112
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:16,182
Oh, here comes your 3:00.

113
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:20,184
I don't mean to sound unprofessional,
but Yum!

114
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:27,491
Paolo! Hi! What are you doing here?

115
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,769
Rachella tell me you...

116
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:34,495
... massage?

117
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:37,272
Well, Rachella's right.

118
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:43,242
Oh, okay.

119
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,711
I don't know what you just said,
so let's start.

120
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:49,413
I am...

121
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,414
... being naked?

122
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:56,521
That's your decision.
Some people prefer to take off

123
00:09:58,631 --> 00:09:59,825
Being naked!

124
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:05,226
I can't believe you don't
wanna know. I couldn't not know.

125
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,271
If the doctor knows,
Carol and Susan know

126
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:10,140
And Monica knows.

127
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,171
How? I don't even know.

128
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:16,837
Carol called to thank me
for the lasagna. She told me.

129
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:18,946
So what's it gonna be?

130
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:26,648
-Oh, great! Now he knows.
-l' m just excited about being an aunt.

131
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:29,384
Or an uncle.

132
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,726
-Hey, Phoebe.
-Hey, Pheebs.

133
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:36,959
Fine!

134
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:43,802
-What's the matter?
-Nothing. I' m just out of sorts.

135
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,707
Well, you can use some of my sorts.
I rarely use them.

136
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,708
Can we get some cappuccino
over here?

137
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:53,912
Oh, right! That's me!

138
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,548
That table place closes at 7. Come on.

139
00:10:58,824 --> 00:10:59,984
Fine.

140
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:02,952
What is it?

141
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:08,232
-All right. You know Paolo?
-l' m familiar with his work.

142
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:11,263
He made a move on me.

143
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,997
-The store will be open tomorrow.
-More coffee, please.

144
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:18,232
Well, what happened?

145
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:22,572
He came in for a massage,
and everything was fine until....

146
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:28,686
-Oh, my God.
-Are you sure?

147
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:32,450
Oh, yeah. I' m sure.

148
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:40,292
And all of a sudden, his hands
weren't the problem anymore.

149
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,559
Was it...?

150
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:48,968
Boy Scouts could've camped
under there.

151
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:53,702
Wow.

152
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:57,609
-What did you do?
-I dealt with it like a professional.

153
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,614
" Ooh, " what?

154
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:06,916
ma Thurman.

155
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,219
-The actress!
-Uma Thurman!

156
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:11,485
Thanks, Rach.

157
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:16,867
-What'll you do?
-You have to tell her.

158
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:21,733
It's your moral obligation as a friend,
as a woman. It's a feminist issue.

159
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:22,965
Guys?

160
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:26,608
-You have to.
-Feminist issue? That's where I went.

161
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:31,615
-She is gonna hate me!
-Yeah, well....

162
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:41,255
Will you pick one?
Just pick one.

163
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:45,419
-Here, how about that one?
-That's patio furniture.

164
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:50,401
So what? Like people will come in
and think, " Oh, l' m outside again. "

165
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,695
Fine.

166
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,738
What about the birds?

167
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:59,942
I don't know. They don't say,
" Hello, sit here. Eat something. "

168
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:04,174
-You pick one.
-Okay. How about the ladybugs?

169
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,580
Forget about the birds, but big red
insects suggest fine dining.

170
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:13,219
-Fine! Want the birds? Get the birds!
-Not like that, I won't.

171
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:18,694
Kip would have liked the birds.

172
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,443
-Hi, Pheebs.
-What's going on?

173
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:35,239
-Are you moving out?
-l' m getting ready for the weekend.

174
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:39,712
Are your weekends longer
than two days?

175
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:42,444
These aren't all my suitcases.

176
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:44,087
This one's Paolo's.

177
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:51,328
-Rachel, can we talk for a sec?
-Well, sure.

178
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,930
Just for a sec, Paolo's on his way.

179
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:08,974
We haven't known each other that long.

180
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,911
There are three things
you should know:

181
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:16,577
One, my friends are the most
important thing in my life.

182
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:18,653
Two, I never lie.

183
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:23,792
And three, I make the best
oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.

184
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:28,862
Okay. Thanks, Pheebs.

185
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,530
-Oh, my God!
-I know.

186
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:38,969
Why have I never tasted these?

187
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:44,046
I don't make them a lot, because
it's not fair to the other cookies.

188
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:53,181
These are the best
oatmeal raisin cookies.

189
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:57,086
-Which proves that I never lie.
-I guess you don't.

190
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,064
Paolo made a pass at me.

191
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,663
What do you think?

192
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:06,736
It's the most beautiful table
I've seen.

193
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:08,133
I know.

194
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,138
Will you balance plates
on these heads?

195
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:14,005
Who cares? We'll eat at the sink.
Come on!

196
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:17,872
Heads up, Ross.

197
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,381
Score! You suck!

198
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:24,853
Are you okay?

199
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,257
I need some mik.

200
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:33,031
Okay. I've got milk.

201
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,435
Here you go.

202
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:49,480
Better?

203
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,344
No.

204
00:15:54,787 --> 00:16:00,054
I feel so stupid! I think about
the other day with you guys.

205
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:03,887
And I was all, " Oh, Paolo!
He's so great!

206
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,824
He makes me feel so"

207
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:07,792
God!

208
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,026
I' m so embarrassed!

209
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:11,793
I' m so embarrassed.

210
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:15,440
-l' m the one he hit on.
-I unleashed him on you.

211
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,472
If I had never met him

212
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,769
-l' m so sorry.
-No, l' m sorry.

213
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:22,309
-l' m sorry.
-l' m sorry. Wait.

214
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:25,105
-What are we sorry about?
-I don't know.

215
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:27,375
Right. He's the pig.

216
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:30,316
-Such a pig!
-Oh, God, he's such a pig!

217
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:33,992
He's like a big disgusting pig....

218
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,557
-Pig man!
-Yes, good!

219
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:43,893
But he was my pig man!

220
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:47,265
How did I not see this?

221
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:49,967
Oh, I know!

222
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:54,340
Because...

223
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:56,581
... he's gorgeous.

224
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:58,406
And he's charming.

225
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,380
-And when he looks
-Okay, Pheebs.

226
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:03,111
The end.

227
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:06,480
God.

228
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,586
Should I not have told you?

229
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:14,696
T rust me, it's much better
that I know.

230
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:21,929
But I just liked it better before.
It was better.

231
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:42,649
She took it pretty well.
Paolo's over there now, so....

232
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:47,328
We should go and see if she's okay.
Just one second.

233
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:51,065
-Score!
-Game! Nice!

234
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:54,566
Come on, Pheebs.

235
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:59,177
Well, it looks like we
kicked your butts.

236
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:03,508
She did. You could be on the Olympic
"Standing There" team.

237
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,182
Come on. Two on one.

238
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:08,012
Why are you here?
She just broke up with him.

239
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,518
It's time for you to swoop in.

240
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:13,920
-What, now?
-Yes. Now is when you swoop.

241
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:17,994
When Paolo walks out,
you gotta be the first guy she sees.

242
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:22,963
She's gotta know you' re everything
he's not. You' re the anti-Paolo.

243
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:26,637
My Catholic friend is right.

244
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,433
She's distraught.
You' re there for her.

245
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:35,443
You pick up the pieces and then
you usher in "The Age of Ross. "

246
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,949
-See this? See?
-Hold it! Ascolta!

247
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,227
-How's it going?
-Don't stare.

248
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:55,389
She threw his clothes off the balcony.
Now there's gesturing and arm-waving.

249
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:59,196
That is, " How could you? "
or " Enormous breasts! "

250
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:02,935
Here he comes.

251
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:14,649
I am...

252
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:16,844
...to say goodbye.

253
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,812
Okay, bye-bye.

254
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:27,630
Paolo, I really hate you for what you
did, but I still have five of these...

255
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,768
...so heat it at 375
until the cheese bubbles.

256
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:40,537
I just wanna tell you, and I think
I'd speak for everyone when I say....

257
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,853
Oh, just look at her.

258
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:51,646
Guys, I think only one of us
should go...

259
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,189
-...so she's not overwhelmed.
-Right.

260
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:56,861
And I really think it should be me.

261
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:15,045
You all right?

262
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:17,915
I've been better.

263
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:21,116
I don't believe this.

264
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,880
I wasn't supposed to care
about this guy.

265
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:29,789
It was just supposed to be
this big, fun, ltalian thing.

266
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:35,489
Someday I could look back and say,
"That was a big, fun, ltalian thing. "

267
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:40,599
It wasn't supposed to feel
like this when it was over.

268
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:44,202
Come here.

269
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,906
Listen...

270
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:56,178
...you deserve
so much better than him.

271
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:58,379
I mean, you...

272
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:02,820
...should be with a guy who knows
what he has when he has you.

273
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:07,622
What?

274
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:11,263
I' m so sick of guys!

275
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:16,634
I don't want to look at
or think about another guy.

276
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:19,970
I don't even want
to be near another guy.

277
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:29,613
Ross, you' re so great.

278
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:43,534
-Are you all right?
-Are you okay?

279
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:47,501
-Medium. Any cookies left?
-Yeah.

280
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:51,940
See, Rach...

281
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:56,547
... I don't think swearing off guys
altogether is the answer.

282
00:21:56,748 --> 00:22:01,276
What you need is to develop a more
sophisticated screening process.

283
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:05,784
I just need to be by myself
for a while.

284
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:09,483
-I just gotta figure out what I want.
-No, no.

285
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:14,354
See, because not all guys out there
are gonna be a Paolo.

286
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:16,500
No, I know. I know.

287
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:20,832
And l' m sure your little boy's
not gonna grow up to be one.

288
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:23,866
-What?
-What?

289
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,773
I' m having a boy?

290
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:30,338
No.

291
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:34,575
No. In fact, you' re not having a boy.

292
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:36,950
I' m having a boy.

293
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:42,152
-Huh? Am I having a boy?
-You' re having a boy!

294
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:43,956
I' m having a boy!

295
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:46,221
-l' m having a boy!
-What is it?

296
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:49,059
I' m having a boy!
I' m having a boy!

297
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:54,499
We already knew that!

298
00:22:57,776 --> 00:22:59,539
I' m having a son.

299
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:10,382
Yes! And that would be a shutdown!

300
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:11,817
Shutout!

301
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:17,887
Where you going? One more game!

302
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:21,293
-It's 2:30 in the morning.
-Yeah, get out!

303
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,792
You guys always hang out
in my apartment.

304
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:27,437
I'll only use my left hand.

305
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:29,663
Come on, wussies!

306
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:35,742
All right! Okay! I gotta go!

307
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,442
I' m going.

308
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:39,316
And l' m gone.

309
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,917
-One more game?
-Oh, yeah.

310
