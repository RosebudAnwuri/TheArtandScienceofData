00:00:05,669 --> 00:00:07,307
-Hi, guys.
-Hey, Phoebe.

2
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:08,743
How did it go?

3
00:00:08,989 --> 00:00:09,819
Not so good.

4
00:00:10,029 --> 00:00:13,226
He walked me home and said,
''We should do this again. ''

5
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:16,782
He said, ''We should do it again. ''
That's good, right?

6
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:19,862
Loosely translated,
''We should do this again,'' means:

7
00:00:20,109 --> 00:00:22,065
''You will never see me naked. ''

8
00:00:23,229 --> 00:00:24,457
Since when?

9
00:00:24,709 --> 00:00:27,826
Since always.
It's, like, ''dating'' language.

10
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:31,027
Like, ''It's not you,''
means, ''It is you. ''

11
00:00:32,469 --> 00:00:36,144
''You're nice,'' means, ''I'll be
dating leather-clad alcoholics. . .

12
00:00:36,349 --> 00:00:38,624
. . .and complaining
about them to you. ''

13
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:41,663
''I think we should see
other people,'' means:

14
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:43,308
''Ha, ha, I already am! ''

15
00:00:44,709 --> 00:00:46,062
Everybody knows this?

16
00:00:47,069 --> 00:00:48,138
Cushions the blow.

17
00:00:48,389 --> 00:00:50,619
Like your parents
putting the dog to sleep. . .

18
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:52,939
. . .and saying it went to
live on a farm.

19
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:56,460
That's funny. Because our
parents actually did. . .

20
00:00:56,709 --> 00:00:59,621
. . .send our dog off to live on a farm.

21
00:01:00,389 --> 00:01:01,822
Ross. . .?

22
00:01:03,309 --> 00:01:05,869
Hello! The Milner's farm
in Connecticut?

23
00:01:06,109 --> 00:01:08,339
The Milners had this
unbelievable farm.

24
00:01:08,589 --> 00:01:10,978
They had horses and
rabbits to chase.

25
00:01:11,229 --> 00:01:12,582
And it was. . . .

26
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:17,818
Oh, my God! Chi-Chi!

27
00:01:19,989 --> 00:01:22,025
The One With the Thumb

''How does it feel knowing
you're about to die?''

30
00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:20,106
Warden, in five minutes
my pain will be over.

31
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:24,945
But you'll live with the knowledge
that you sent an honest man to die.

32
00:02:26,109 --> 00:02:27,747
That was really good!

33
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:30,021
Thanks. Let's keep going.

34
00:02:30,309 --> 00:02:34,063
''So, what do you want
from me, Dimon? Huh?''

35
00:02:36,509 --> 00:02:40,263
I just wanna go back to my cell,
because in my cell I can smoke.

36
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:41,385
''Smoke away! ''

37
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:58,299
I think this is probably why Dimon
smokes in his cell alone.

38
00:02:59,309 --> 00:03:01,140
-What?
-Relax your hand.

39
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:03,061
Let your wrist go.

40
00:03:03,309 --> 00:03:04,219
Not so much.

41
00:03:06,469 --> 00:03:08,425
All right. Now try taking a puff.

42
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:10,422
Right.

43
00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:12,945
Give it to me.

44
00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:15,384
I'm not giving you a cigarette.

45
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:18,826
It's fine. Do you want to
get this part or not?

46
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:22,427
All right. Now, don't think
of it as a cigarette.

47
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:26,423
Think of it as the thing that
has been missing from your hand.

48
00:03:27,229 --> 00:03:29,424
When you're holding it, you feel right.

49
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:30,818
You feel complete.

50
00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:31,945
You miss it?

51
00:03:32,189 --> 00:03:33,622
No, not so much.

52
00:03:35,309 --> 00:03:37,425
All right. Now we smoke.

53
00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:42,418
Oh, my God!

54
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:54,545
It's the same as the distance
from the tip of a guy's thumb. . .

55
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:57,019
. . .to the tip of his index finger.

56
00:04:02,589 --> 00:04:04,261
That's ridiculous.

57
00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:07,108
Can I use either thumb?

58
00:04:09,109 --> 00:04:11,020
All right. Don't tell me.

59
00:04:12,029 --> 00:04:15,021
Decaf cappuccino for Joey.

60
00:04:16,669 --> 00:04:18,421
Coffee, black.

61
00:04:19,429 --> 00:04:20,578
Latte.

62
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:23,778
And an iced tea.

63
00:04:24,029 --> 00:04:25,348
I'm getting good at this.

64
00:04:25,589 --> 00:04:26,385
Excellent!

65
00:04:27,549 --> 00:04:28,777
Good for me!

66
00:04:42,109 --> 00:04:42,905
You okay, Phoebe?

67
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:44,628
It's not even worth--

68
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:46,222
It's my bank.

69
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:47,618
What did they do?

70
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:52,463
I'm going through my mail, and I
open up their monthly ''statement. ''

71
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:53,824
Easy!

72
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:58,469
And there's $500 extra in my account.

73
00:04:59,029 --> 00:05:01,623
Satan's minions at work again!

74
00:05:02,349 --> 00:05:04,738
Now I have to go down there
and deal with them--

75
00:05:04,989 --> 00:05:06,707
What are you talking about?
Keep it!

76
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:08,018
It's not mine.

77
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:10,743
If I kept it, it would be
like stealing.

78
00:05:10,989 --> 00:05:14,345
Yeah, but if you spent it,
it would be like shopping.

79
00:05:16,829 --> 00:05:18,820
Say I bought
a great pair of shoes.

80
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:21,145
Know what I'd hear
with every step I took?

81
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:23,857
''Not mine. Not mine. Not mine. ''

82
00:05:24,109 --> 00:05:26,669
And even if I was happy
and skipping. . .

83
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:29,901
. . .I'd hear, ''Not-not mine.
Not-not mine. ''

84
00:05:30,149 --> 00:05:31,707
We're with you. We got it.

85
00:05:32,869 --> 00:05:36,782
I'd never be able to enjoy it.
It'd be like this giant karmic debt.

86
00:05:36,989 --> 00:05:38,627
Chandler, what are you doing?

87
00:05:39,429 --> 00:05:41,021
What are you doing?

88
00:05:44,029 --> 00:05:46,020
Oh, gross!

89
00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:47,579
What is this?

90
00:05:47,829 --> 00:05:49,023
I'm smoking! I'm smoking!

91
00:05:49,269 --> 00:05:51,624
You've been so good for three years!

92
00:05:51,869 --> 00:05:54,224
And this is my reward.

93
00:05:55,629 --> 00:05:58,826
Just think about what you went
through the last time you quit.

94
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:00,866
So this time I won't quit.

95
00:06:01,669 --> 00:06:03,387
All right! I'm putting it out!

96
00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:06,022
Oh, no!

97
00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:08,225
I can't drink this now.

98
00:06:12,109 --> 00:06:14,145
I'm gonna go change.
I've got a date.

99
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:16,698
Is this Alan again?
How's it going?

100
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:20,862
It's going pretty good.
It's nice and we're having fun.

101
00:06:21,109 --> 00:06:22,861
When do we get to meet the guy?

102
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:24,821
Let's see, today's Monday. . . .

103
00:06:25,069 --> 00:06:26,422
Never!

104
00:06:26,909 --> 00:06:28,820
Not after what happened with Steve.

105
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:29,984
What do you mean?

106
00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:33,380
We love Steve. Steve was sexy!

107
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:37,139
Sorry.

108
00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:40,381
I don't know how I feel about him.
Let me figure it out.

109
00:06:40,589 --> 00:06:41,658
Then can we meet him?

110
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:45,222
Sorry.

111
00:06:48,669 --> 00:06:50,148
Why should they meet him?

112
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:53,142
I bring a guy home and they're
all over him like. . .

113
00:06:53,829 --> 00:06:57,026
. . .coyotes picking off the weak
members of the herd.

114
00:06:57,629 --> 00:07:01,861
Listen, as someone who's seen
more than her share of bad beef. . .

115
00:07:02,109 --> 00:07:05,658
. . .I'll tell you, that is not
such a terrible thing.

116
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:08,264
Your friends are just
looking out after you.

117
00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:11,660
I wish that once I'd
bring a guy home they actually liked.

118
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:15,345
You realize the odds of that
happening are a little slimmer. . .

119
00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:17,819
. . .if they never get to meet the guy.

120
00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:20,218
Let it go, Ross.

121
00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:22,627
You didn't know Chi-Chi.

122
00:07:26,589 --> 00:07:27,658
Do you all promise?

123
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:30,469
Yeah, we promise.
We'll be good.

124
00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:33,422
Chandler, do you promise to be good?

125
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:44,868
You can come in, but your filter
tip little buddy stays outside!

126
00:07:54,229 --> 00:07:55,378
''Dear Ms. Buffay:

127
00:07:55,629 --> 00:07:57,142
Thank you for calling.

128
00:07:57,389 --> 00:08:01,428
We have credited your account $500.
We're sorry for the inconvenience. . .

129
00:08:01,629 --> 00:08:04,427
. . .and hope you'll accept
this football phone. . .

130
00:08:07,509 --> 00:08:09,420
. . .as our gift. ''
Do you believe it?

131
00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:12,741
Now I have $ 1 000
and a football phone.

132
00:08:14,349 --> 00:08:16,624
What bank is this?

133
00:08:17,509 --> 00:08:19,420
Okay, it's him.

134
00:08:21,109 --> 00:08:22,144
-Who is it?
-Alan.

135
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:23,981
Chandler! He's here!

136
00:08:26,989 --> 00:08:28,820
Please be good. Please?

137
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,023
Just remember how much
you all like me.

138
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:36,863
Alan, this is everybody.
Everybody, this is Alan.

139
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:44,422
I've heard so much about
all you guys.

140
00:08:51,349 --> 00:08:53,021
I'll call you tomorrow.

141
00:08:57,469 --> 00:09:00,620
Let's let the Alan-bashing begin.

142
00:09:00,909 --> 00:09:02,661
Who's gonna take the first shot?

143
00:09:04,469 --> 00:09:05,663
Come on!

144
00:09:06,509 --> 00:09:07,828
I'll go.

145
00:09:10,469 --> 00:09:12,858
Let's start with the way he
kept picking at--

146
00:09:13,109 --> 00:09:14,428
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

147
00:09:14,669 --> 00:09:16,022
Can't do it. We loved him.

148
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:17,463
We loved him!

149
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:18,744
Wait a minute!

150
00:09:18,989 --> 00:09:21,423
We're talking about someone
I'm going out with?

151
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:23,701
And did you notice?

152
00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:31,542
Know what was great?
The way his smile was crooked.

153
00:09:31,789 --> 00:09:33,586
Yes! Like the man in the shoe!

154
00:09:34,429 --> 00:09:35,498
What shoe?

155
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:38,143
From the nursery rhyme.

156
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:40,459
''There was a crooked man
with a crooked smile. . .

157
00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:43,269
. . .who lived in a shoe for a while. . . . ''

158
00:09:46,189 --> 00:09:48,020
So I think Alan. . .

159
00:09:48,669 --> 00:09:52,582
. . .is the yardstick against which all
future boyfriends will be measured.

160
00:09:52,829 --> 00:09:53,944
What future boyfriends?

161
00:09:54,189 --> 00:09:57,226
-I think this could be, you know, ''it. ''
-Really?

162
00:09:57,469 --> 00:10:01,223
I'd marry him for his
David Hasselhoff impression alone.

163
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:03,818
You know I'll be doing that
at parties, right?

164
00:10:07,589 --> 00:10:10,023
-Know what I like most about him?
-What?

165
00:10:10,789 --> 00:10:13,826
The way he makes me feel about myself.

166
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:35,984
How was the game?

167
00:10:37,309 --> 00:10:38,628
Well. . . .

168
00:10:38,989 --> 00:10:40,627
We won!

169
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:44,902
Fantastic! One question:
How is that possible?

170
00:10:45,909 --> 00:10:48,059
-Alan.
-He was unbelievable!

171
00:10:48,269 --> 00:10:51,659
He was like a Bugs Bunny cartoon
where Bugs plays every position.

172
00:10:51,909 --> 00:10:55,219
But instead of Bugs, it was 1 st
base, Alan. 2nd base, Alan. . . .

173
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:02,065
It was like he made us into a team.

174
00:11:02,309 --> 00:11:06,621
We sure showed those Hasidic jewelers
a thing or two about softball.

175
00:11:08,109 --> 00:11:09,701
Can I ask you guys a question?

176
00:11:09,909 --> 00:11:12,264
Do you think Alan
is maybe sometimes--

177
00:11:12,509 --> 00:11:13,419
What?

178
00:11:13,669 --> 00:11:16,137
I don't know. A little too ''Alan''?

179
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:19,699
Oh, no. That's not possible.
You can never be too ''Alan. ''

180
00:11:19,949 --> 00:11:23,942
It's his innate ''Alan-ness''
that we adore.

181
00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:26,825
I, personally, could have
a gallon of Alan.

182
00:11:32,589 --> 00:11:33,624
Hey, Lizzy.

183
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:35,148
Hey, Weird Girl.

184
00:11:35,349 --> 00:11:38,227
-I bought alphabet soup.
-Did you pick out the vowels?

185
00:11:38,429 --> 00:11:41,227
I left in the Y's.
Because ''--sometimes Y. ''

186
00:11:42,509 --> 00:11:43,578
And something else.

187
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:44,784
Saltines?

188
00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:47,224
Would you like $ 1 000
and a football phone?

189
00:11:47,789 --> 00:11:49,017
What?

190
00:11:50,189 --> 00:11:51,702
Oh, my God!

191
00:11:51,949 --> 00:11:54,543
-There's really money in here.
-I know.

192
00:11:54,829 --> 00:11:56,342
What are you doing?

193
00:11:56,589 --> 00:11:59,228
I want you to have it.
I don't want it.

194
00:11:59,669 --> 00:12:01,421
I have to give you something.

195
00:12:01,669 --> 00:12:03,182
No, it's fine. You don't--

196
00:12:03,429 --> 00:12:05,260
Do you want my tinfoil hat?

197
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:08,182
No, you need that.
It's okay. Thanks.

198
00:12:08,429 --> 00:12:10,624
Please. Let me do something.

199
00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:14,942
I'll tell you what. You buy me
a soda and we're even. Okay?

200
00:13:16,589 --> 00:13:18,227
Keep the change.

201
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:19,659
Thanks, Lizzy.

202
00:13:19,909 --> 00:13:21,058
Want a pretzel?

203
00:13:21,309 --> 00:13:24,221
-No, I'm fine. Thanks.
-See you.

204
00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:32,505
A thumb?

205
00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:37,179
I know. I opened it
and there it was. . .

206
00:13:37,429 --> 00:13:40,580
. . .floating in there, like
this tiny little hitchhiker.

207
00:13:42,429 --> 00:13:44,943
Maybe it's a contest?
Like ''Collect all five. ''

208
00:13:47,389 --> 00:13:48,583
Does anyone wanna see?

209
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:50,103
No, thanks!

210
00:13:51,989 --> 00:13:53,468
Don't do that. Come on!

211
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:55,062
It's worse than the thumb.

212
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:58,543
This is so unfair.

213
00:13:58,789 --> 00:14:00,108
Why is it unfair?

214
00:14:00,349 --> 00:14:02,943
So I have a flaw! Big deal!

215
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:05,703
Joey's constant knuckle-
cracking isn't annoying?

216
00:14:05,949 --> 00:14:07,985
And Ross, over-pronouncing
every word.

217
00:14:08,229 --> 00:14:10,424
And Monica, who snorts
when she laughs.

218
00:14:10,669 --> 00:14:12,819
I mean, what the hell
is that thing?

219
00:14:14,469 --> 00:14:17,620
I accept those flaws.
Why can't you accept me for this?

220
00:14:24,509 --> 00:14:27,626
Does the knuckle-cracking
bother everybody, or just him?

221
00:14:31,389 --> 00:14:33,061
I could live without it.

222
00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:40,220
Is it like, a little annoying? Or
is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?

223
00:14:43,069 --> 00:14:46,061
Don't listen to him, Pheebs.
I think it's endearing.

224
00:14:46,309 --> 00:14:48,425
Oh, you do, do you?

225
00:14:54,389 --> 00:14:57,381
There's nothing wrong with
speaking correctly.

226
00:14:57,629 --> 00:15:00,223
lndeed there isn't.

227
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:03,987
I should get back to work.

228
00:15:04,229 --> 00:15:07,426
Otherwise someone might
get what they actually ordered.

229
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:12,582
The hair comes out
and the gloves come off.

230
00:15:27,429 --> 00:15:30,819
Did you ever go out with a guy
your friends all really like?

231
00:15:31,229 --> 00:15:32,218
No.

232
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:37,617
Well, I'm going out with a guy
my friends all really like.

233
00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:41,418
Are we talking about the coyotes here?

234
00:15:41,669 --> 00:15:44,820
All right! A cow got through.

235
00:15:45,869 --> 00:15:47,188
Can you believe it?

236
00:15:47,429 --> 00:15:48,987
It's just, you know what?

237
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:51,862
I just don't feel the ''thing. ''

238
00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:54,537
They feel the thing.
I don't feel the thing.

239
00:15:54,789 --> 00:15:57,508
Honey, you should always. . .

240
00:15:57,709 --> 00:15:59,347
. . .feel the thing.

241
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:04,866
If that's how you feel about
the guy, dump him.

242
00:16:05,109 --> 00:16:06,667
It's gonna be really hard.

243
00:16:06,909 --> 00:16:08,661
He's a big boy.
He'll get over it.

244
00:16:08,909 --> 00:16:13,221
No, he'll be fine. It's the other
five I'm worried about.

245
00:16:13,989 --> 00:16:15,581
Don't you respect your body?

246
00:16:15,829 --> 00:16:17,467
Don't you see what you're doing?

247
00:16:18,069 --> 00:16:20,025
I've had it with you
and your cancer. . .

248
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,026
. . .emphysema and heart disease.

249
00:16:22,229 --> 00:16:25,619
The bottom line is smoking is cool,
and you know it.

250
00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:31,261
Alan wants to speak to you.

251
00:16:31,509 --> 00:16:33,227
Really? He does?

252
00:16:34,749 --> 00:16:36,626
Hey, buddy! What's up?

253
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:40,459
She told you about that, huh?

254
00:16:41,389 --> 00:16:45,018
Well, yeah. I have one now
and then. Well, yeah, now.

255
00:16:46,109 --> 00:16:47,622
It's not that bad--

256
00:16:49,789 --> 00:16:51,620
Well, that's true.

257
00:16:53,869 --> 00:16:57,828
Gee, no one's ever put it
like that before.

258
00:16:58,109 --> 00:17:00,020
Well, okay. Thanks.

259
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:10,978
God, he's good.

260
00:17:12,669 --> 00:17:14,068
If only he were a woman.

261
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:22,462
Oh, Lamb Chop!

262
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,223
How old is that sock?

263
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:29,818
If I had a sock on my hand
for 30 years, it'd be talking too.

264
00:17:31,389 --> 00:17:35,826
I think it's time to change
somebody's nicotine patch.

265
00:17:39,629 --> 00:17:40,425
Where's Joey?

266
00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:43,547
Joey ate my last stick
of gum, so I killed him.

267
00:17:45,069 --> 00:17:47,025
Do you think that was wrong?

268
00:17:48,589 --> 00:17:49,908
I think he's across the hall.

269
00:17:51,709 --> 00:17:53,222
There you go.

270
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:56,139
Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.

271
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:59,623
Pheebs, do you want
the rest of that Pop Tart?

272
00:18:01,709 --> 00:18:04,223
Does anyone want
the rest of this Pop Tart?

273
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:07,422
Hey, I might.

274
00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:09,822
I'm sorry.

275
00:18:10,309 --> 00:18:13,665
Those stupid soda people gave
me $ 7000 for the thumb.

276
00:18:15,709 --> 00:18:18,098
And on my way over here
I stepped in gum.

277
00:18:19,629 --> 00:18:21,745
What is up with the universe?

278
00:18:21,989 --> 00:18:22,899
What's going on?

279
00:18:23,149 --> 00:18:25,663
Nothing. I think it's nice
when we're together.

280
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:29,026
It's even nicer when everyone
gets to wear their underwear.

281
00:18:39,349 --> 00:18:41,101
Please, guys, we have to talk.

282
00:18:41,309 --> 00:18:42,105
Wait, wait!

283
00:18:42,349 --> 00:18:44,021
I'm getting a déjà vu.

284
00:18:44,269 --> 00:18:45,418
No, I'm not.

285
00:18:48,109 --> 00:18:49,098
We have to talk.

286
00:18:49,349 --> 00:18:50,225
There it is!

287
00:18:53,429 --> 00:18:55,260
It's about Alan.

288
00:18:56,029 --> 00:18:58,020
There's something you should know.

289
00:18:59,509 --> 00:19:02,626
There's really no
easy way to say this.

290
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,698
I've decided to break up with Alan.

291
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:12,827
Is there somebody else?

292
00:19:16,229 --> 00:19:17,218
It's just. . .

293
00:19:17,429 --> 00:19:20,262
. . .you know, things change.
People change.

294
00:19:20,509 --> 00:19:22,625
We didn't change.

295
00:19:24,829 --> 00:19:26,706
So that's it? It's over?

296
00:19:28,349 --> 00:19:29,623
Just like that?

297
00:19:30,709 --> 00:19:35,419
You let your guard down. You start
to care about someone, and I just--

298
00:19:38,949 --> 00:19:41,668
-I can go on pretending--
-Okay!

299
00:19:42,869 --> 00:19:45,588
That wouldn't be fair to me,
to Alan, or to you.

300
00:19:46,029 --> 00:19:48,020
Well, who wants fair?

301
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:51,824
I just want things back, you know,
the way they were.

302
00:19:53,709 --> 00:19:54,505
I'm sorry.

303
00:19:54,749 --> 00:19:57,627
Oh, she's sorry.
I feel better.

304
00:19:59,309 --> 00:20:00,662
I just can't believe this!

305
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:05,221
With the holidays coming up.
I wanted him to meet my family.

306
00:20:06,589 --> 00:20:09,422
I'll meet someone else.
There'll be other Alans.

307
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:10,704
Yeah, right!

308
00:20:15,389 --> 00:20:17,027
Are you guys gonna be okay?

309
00:20:17,229 --> 00:20:18,821
We'll be fine.

310
00:20:19,029 --> 00:20:21,463
We're just gonna need a little time.

311
00:20:22,309 --> 00:20:24,027
I understand.

312
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:31,339
I'm really sorry.

313
00:20:31,589 --> 00:20:34,228
I mean, I'm sorry too.

314
00:20:34,829 --> 00:20:36,820
But I'm a little relieved.

315
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:37,899
Relieved?

316
00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:41,420
Well, l mean, l had
a great time with you.

317
00:20:42,029 --> 00:20:44,418
I just can't stand your friends.

318
00:20:51,109 --> 00:20:54,419
Remember when we went to
Central Park and rented boats?

319
00:20:56,429 --> 00:20:57,828
That was fun.

320
00:20:59,709 --> 00:21:01,825
He could row like a Viking.

321
00:21:10,349 --> 00:21:11,145
So how'd it go?

322
00:21:13,029 --> 00:21:13,825
You know.

323
00:21:14,069 --> 00:21:15,821
Did he mention us?

324
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:23,623
He says he's really gonna
miss you guys.

325
00:21:29,909 --> 00:21:31,058
Rough day, huh?

326
00:21:31,309 --> 00:21:32,628
You have no idea.

327
00:21:32,829 --> 00:21:34,228
Come here.

328
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:39,420
That's it.
I'm getting cigarettes.

329
00:21:40,189 --> 00:21:41,065
I don't care!

330
00:21:41,309 --> 00:21:44,267
I'm weak! I've gotta smoke!
I've gotta have the smoke!

331
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:47,461
If you never smoke again,
I'll give you $ 7000.

332
00:21:48,109 --> 00:21:49,622
Yeah, all right.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
