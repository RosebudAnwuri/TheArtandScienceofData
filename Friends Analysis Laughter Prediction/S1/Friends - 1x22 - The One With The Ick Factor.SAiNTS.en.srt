00:00:01,034 --> 00:00:02,763
-Tell him.
-Tell him.

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:05,130
-Shut up.
-Tell me what?

3
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:06,771
You won't look at him.

4
00:00:06,973 --> 00:00:10,875
I could use another
reason why women won't look at me.

5
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:15,604
All right. All right.
Last night, I had a dream...

6
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:18,248
...that you and I were

7
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:21,249
Doing it on this table.

8
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:25,285
Excellent dream score.

9
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:30,930
Why would you dream that?

10
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:33,830
More importantly...

11
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:35,329
...was I any good?

12
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,432
Well, you were pretty damn good.

13
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:44,233
Interesting. In my dreams,
I'm surprisingly inadequate.

14
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:49,374
Last night, you seemed to know
your way around the table.

15
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:54,650
I love it when we share.

16
00:00:58,658 --> 00:00:59,818
You okay?

17
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:03,484
I can't believe you two
had sex in her dream.

18
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:05,731
Sorry, it was a one-time thing.

19
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:10,369
I was very drunk, and it was
someone else's subconscious.

20
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:13,168
The One With The lck Factor

21
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:00,613
Hello, Rachel.

22
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:02,653
Get off.

23
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:09,659
Ooh, give me. Can you see me
operating a drill press?

24
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:12,657
I don't know.
What are you wearing?

25
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:18,497
Why would you want to?

26
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:22,664
For short-term work. Till I get
back my massage clients.

27
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:24,468
Pirates again?

28
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:27,545
No. Nothing like that.

29
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,941
I'm just such a dummy.

30
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:35,314
I taught a "Massage Yourself at Home"
workshop. And they are.

31
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,920
Hey, Chan, she could work for you.

32
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,627
Thanks, Joey. That's a good idea.

33
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:44,828
I could. I could do it. What is it?

34
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:50,229
My secretary's gonna be out.
She's having one of her boobs reduced.

35
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:53,165
It's a whole big boob story.

36
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:57,833
-I could be a secretary.
-I don't know if it'd be your thing...

37
00:02:58,044 --> 00:03:02,947
... because it involves being
normal for a large portion of the day.

38
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,078
I could do that.

39
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:08,780
-What's that?
-My new beeper.

40
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:11,456
Why does a paleontologist
need a beeper?

41
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:16,788
Is it for dinosaur emergencies?
Help. They're still extinct.

42
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:20,755
It's for when Carol goes into labor.

43
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:24,629
All she has to do is dial 55-JlMBO.

44
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:28,929
A cool number and
a possible name for the kid.

45
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:31,804
-See you later.
-Off to see young Ethan?

46
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:33,677
Thank you.

47
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:37,175
How young is young Ethan?
Young?

48
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:40,346
He's our age.

49
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,178
When we were....

50
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,019
-He's a senior in college.
-College?

51
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,663
Rob that cradle.

52
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:56,261
He's smart and mature and grown-up.

53
00:03:56,469 --> 00:04:00,872
Mature and grown-up, he's a big boy.

54
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,471
This man-child has no problem
with how old you are?

55
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:08,039
No, of course not.
It's not even an issue...

56
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:09,975
... because I said I was 22.

57
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:11,480
-You what?
-What?

58
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:15,176
-Oh, I can't pass for 22?
-Well, maybe 25, 26.

59
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:18,150
-I am 26.
-There you go.

60
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,767
Can you hear that?

61
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:40,067
That'll stop
when you pick up the phone.

62
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:43,948
-Oh, I'm on.
-Okay.

63
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:47,781
Mr. Bing's office.

64
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:53,849
-Sorry, he's in a meeting.
-I'm not in a meeting.

65
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,823
Will he know what
this is in reference to?

66
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,622
And he has your number?

67
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:02,528
I'll see that he gets
the message. Bye-bye.

68
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,072
Ross says hi.

69
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:10,302
This is so fun.
What do we do now?

70
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,343
Well, now I actually
have to get to work.

71
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:15,240
"Most likely."

72
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:21,413
Okay, I'm gonna be out there.

73
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,588
All right. Bye-bye.

74
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,256
Bye-bye.

75
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,797
-Yes?
-What you doing?

76
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:40,404
Okay, windows are clean.
Candles are lit.

77
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:42,938
BeIt's too tight.
Gotta change.

78
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:47,306
Did I turn the fish?
Nope, because I made lasagna.

79
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:51,146
-Am I out of control?
-Just a touch.

80
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:55,484
I don't understand.
You've been dating this guy since...

81
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,781
... his midterms.

82
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,953
Why, all of a sudden,
are you so...?

83
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:09,494
-What?
-Could tonight be the night?

84
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:14,005
I don't know. He's a great guy...

85
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,505
...and I love being with him.
But, you know...

86
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:22,347
...things happen when they happen.
You don't plan these things.

87
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:25,912
-So, did you shave your legs?
-Yeah.

88
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:32,981
Would you let it go?
It was just a dream.

89
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:34,682
It doesn't mean

90
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:39,027
This is it. It's baby time!

91
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,823
All right, relax. Just relax.
Be cool.

92
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:45,867
Yeah, hi. I was just beeped.

93
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:52,134
No, Andre is not here.
Third time today.

94
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:54,204
Yes, I am sure.

95
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:58,782
I do not perform
those kind of services.

96
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:00,475
Services?

97
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,880
Oh, services.

98
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:05,716
Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO.

99
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:11,162
That's right.

100
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:14,390
That's right.
JUMBO with a "U," sir.

101
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,124
You don't want me.

102
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:20,304
Judging by his number,
I'd be a huge disappointment.

103
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,933
Alrighty, bye-bye.

104
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:28,577
How was the first day?

105
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:32,148
Excellent.
Everyone was so, so nice.

106
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:36,185
It pays to know the man
who wears my shoes.

107
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:37,754
Me.

108
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:41,816
-I didn't tell anyone I knew you.
-Why?

109
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:43,825
Well, because, you know.

110
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:46,322
They don't like you.

111
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:52,162
-What?
-I thought you knew.

112
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:58,234
-Who doesn't like me?
-Everyone.

113
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:00,103
Except for....

114
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:01,937
No. Everyone.

115
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,776
-What are you talking about?
-Don't feel bad.

116
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,250
They used to like you a lot.

117
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:15,223
But you got promoted, and now you're
Mr. Boss Man. Mr. Big.

118
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:18,055
Mr. Bing. Boss Man Bing.

119
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:23,135
-I can't believe it.
-Yeah. They even do you.

120
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:26,672
They "do" me?

121
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:28,533
You know, like, okay:

122
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,707
"Could that report be any later?"

123
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:40,214
-I don't sound like that.
-Yeah, you do.

124
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,888
"The hills are alive
with the sound...

125
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,189
...of music."

126
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,690
"My scone. My scone."

127
00:08:57,837 --> 00:09:01,238
I don't sound like that.
That is so not true.

128
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,344
That is so not
That is so not

129
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:07,670
That
Oh, shut up.

130
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,978
-Did not.
-Up until I was 9...

131
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:17,745
... I thought "gunpoint" was
a place where crimes happened.

132
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:20,983
-How's that possible?
-It's always on the news.

133
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:23,787
"A man is being held up at Gunpoint."

134
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:26,294
"Tourists are terrorized
at Gunpoint."

135
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:31,236
And I kept thinking,
"Why do people continue to go there?"

136
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:37,871
I should go.

137
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:48,643
-Unless
-What?

138
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:51,982
Unless you wanna stay over.

139
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:54,852
I mean, I'm going to. So....

140
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:58,823
Yeah, I'd really like that.

141
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:10,371
Before we get into any
staying-over stuff...

142
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,078
...there's something you should know.

143
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,544
Is this, like,
"I have an early class tomorrow"...

144
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,410
...or "I'm secretly married
to a goat"?

145
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:23,547
Well, it's somewhere in between.

146
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:27,954
You see, in a strictly technical
sense, of course, I'm not....

147
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:31,061
Well, I mean, I haven't ever....

148
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:32,594
Ethan?

149
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:34,563
Are you a virgin?

150
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:39,030
If that's what you kids are
calling it these days, then...

151
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,500
...yes, I am.

152
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:48,175
I mean, you're just such a good kisser
I would never have known.

153
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:53,114
Well, I've excelled at every level
I've been to, I just....

154
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:59,190
I just haven't been to
that particular one yet.

155
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:03,954
I've kind of been waiting
for the right person.

156
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,688
-Really?
-Yeah.

157
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,327
You do know I was talking
about you, right?

158
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:20,644
Wow.

159
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:23,304
You keep saying that.

160
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:27,352
You know, you read about it.
You see it in the movies.

161
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:31,181
Even when you practice it at home,
man, oh, man...

162
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,150
...it is nothing like that.

163
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,591
Listen, listen.

164
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:44,932
You told me something
that was really difficult for you.

165
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:49,267
And I figure if you can
be honest, then I can too.

166
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:52,807
Don't tell me I did it wrong.

167
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,106
Nothing wrong about that.

168
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:02,051
Here goes.

169
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:05,456
I'm not 22.

170
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,357
I'm 25...

171
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:10,993
...and 1 3 months.

172
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:17,594
But I figure that shouldn't
change anything.

173
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:22,740
What does it matter how old we are?
Basically, I'm nuts about you.

174
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:27,879
I knew after the first time we kissed.
You didn't mention the Tic Tac.

175
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,140
I just thought
you were naturally minty.

176
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,949
Listen...

177
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:39,818
...as long as we're
telling stuff...

178
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:42,953
... I have another one for you.

179
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:46,927
I'm a little younger than I said.

180
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:51,762
-You're not a senior?
-Oh, I'm a senior...

181
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,800
...in high school.

182
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:10,419
What we did was wrong.

183
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:15,822
I just had sex with someone who
wasn't alive during the bicentennial.

184
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:20,355
I just had sex.

185
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:26,068
Ethan, focus.
How could you not tell me?

186
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,900
-You never said your age.
-It's different.

187
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:33,340
My lie didn't make one of us
a felon in 48 states.

188
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:37,074
-What were you thinking?
-I was too busy falling

189
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:40,650
-Don't say it.
-ln love with you.

190
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,454
-Really?
-Sorry.

191
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:46,614
Well, fall out of it.

192
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:50,351
You shouldn't be here.
It's a school night.

193
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,129
Oh, God.

194
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:56,630
I'm like those women
that you see...

195
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:59,303
...with shiny guys named Chad.

196
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:04,738
I'm Joan Collins.

197
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:09,136
Who?

198
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:20,556
Andre should be there
in about 45 minutes.

199
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:27,464
Yes, sir, the kimonos are extra.

200
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,192
Alrighty. Bye-bye.

201
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:34,404
It's just easier that way.

202
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:40,472
-You told me about the last dream.
-No. Forget it.

203
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:44,638
Why not? Was I doing
something particularly saucy?

204
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:48,286
All right. Fine.

205
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:53,014
You were not the only one there.

206
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:55,683
Joey was there too.

207
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:58,762
All right.

208
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:01,590
Was there...

209
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:07,602
...anybody else there?

210
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:11,266
You sure? Nobody...

211
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:14,139
... handing out mints or anything?

212
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:18,913
No, it was just the three of us.

213
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:22,515
So was it you and Chandler...

214
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:26,224
...then you and me,
or you, me and Chandler?

215
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,686
-You know what?
-What?

216
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:32,360
There were times...

217
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:34,861
...when it wasn't even me.

218
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:47,843
That is so sweet, you guys.

219
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:56,179
Mon, Ethan called again.

220
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:05,027
-What?
-Ethan called again.

221
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:09,524
-You're not seeing him anymore?
-No.

222
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:12,099
Sometimes, things don't work out.

223
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:17,705
This has nothing to do with him
needing a note to get out of gym?

224
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:23,705
I did not say anything. I swear.

225
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,816
-He stopped by.
-Next time you talk to him...

226
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:31,183
...could you ask him which one
the strongest Power Ranger is?

227
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:36,958
Oh, my life is just so amusing.
Can we drop it now?

228
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:38,390
Sorry.

229
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:40,497
"It's morphin'time."

230
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:43,566
-Stegosaurus.
-Tyrannosaurus.

231
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,305
I gotta go.

232
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:50,972
Head rush.

233
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:55,841
One more, and then I have to go.

234
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:57,378
Cool.

235
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:02,614
Where you going?

236
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:05,449
A birthday party
with some work people.

237
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:09,320
Work people? Nobody told me.

238
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:11,825
I know.
That's part of the whole...

239
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:15,294
...them-not-liking-you
extravaganza.

240
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,694
A month ago,
these people were my friends.

241
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:22,964
I'm in charge,
but I'm not a different person.

242
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:28,143
Then come, hang out. Let them see
what a great guy you still are.

243
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:30,508
-You think I should?
-I really do.

244
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:35,212
But could we not go together?

245
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:39,515
I don't wanna be the geek
who invited the boss.

246
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:46,090
-Hey, you okay?
-Yeah.

247
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:50,928
-This can't be easy for him either.
-I know.

248
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:55,266
This may take some time
for him to get over it...

249
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:59,171
... but, then at four,
Muppet Babies is on.

250
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:09,543
Go deep. Deep. Deep.

251
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:12,723
Sorry, Shelly.

252
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,827
See, with the fun?

253
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:19,853
Last night was great.

254
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,796
The karaoke thing?
Tracy and I doing "Ebony and lvory."

255
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:27,335
You were great.
But they still made fun of you.

256
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:30,235
-What?
-Now you're Mr. Caring Boss.

257
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,033
Mr. I'm-one-of-you Boss.

258
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:35,008
Mr. I-wanna-be-your-buddy
Boss Man Bing.

259
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:37,906
Then I don't get it.

260
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:42,617
You know what?
I think you just gotta face it.

261
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:45,255
You're the guy in the big office.

262
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:48,358
You're the one that hires
and fires them.

263
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:51,256
-They say you're a great boss.
-They do?

264
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:54,966
But they're not
your friends anymore.

265
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,930
-I just want
-But you can't.

266
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,331
But I just want

267
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:11,173
Are you gonna?

268
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:15,149
Carol and I have a new system.
If she punches in 9-1 -1...

269
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:18,755
...she's having a baby.
Otherwise, I just ignore it.

270
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:20,219
What about Andre?

271
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:23,485
He got a call
from our cousin, Nathan.

272
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:27,631
Frankly, it was a little more
than I needed to know.

273
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:37,675
That was gonna be my opener.

274
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:41,944
Have you guys seen those
new hand dryers in the bathroom?

275
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:45,446
-I thought that was just a rumor.
-True story.

276
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:51,317
Look, I gotta tell you something.

277
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:55,357
I'm not 1 7. I said that so you'd
think I was vulnerable.

278
00:19:55,594 --> 00:20:00,031
I'm actually 30. I have a wife
and a job. I'm your congressman.

279
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:04,028
This is ridiculous.
We're great together.

280
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:08,171
We can talk, make each other
laugh, and the sex....

281
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:12,309
I have no frame of reference,
but I thought that was great.

282
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:15,480
-lt was.
-Then what's the problem?

283
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:19,006
Ethan, it's....

284
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,950
It's icky.

285
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,719
"lcky"?

286
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:29,485
You're actually gonna throw this away
because it's "icky"?

287
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:33,756
This isn't easy for me either.
I wish things were different.

288
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:36,592
If you were older
or I was younger...

289
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:40,293
...or we lived in biblical times...

290
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:43,065
-... I could really
-No, don't say it.

291
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:45,140
Love you.

292
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,314
-Are your hands still wet?
-Moist.

293
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:53,450
Let's dry them again.

294
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:03,057
Or, like, "Could these margaritas
be any stronger?"

295
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,090
Hey, Chandler.

296
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:07,696
Hello, Mr. Bing.

297
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:11,232
Loved your Stevie Wonder last night.

298
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:17,268
Thanks. About the weekly numbers, I'm
gonna need them on my desk by 9:00.

299
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:19,376
-Sure.
-No problem.

300
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:24,507
You have to give them something.

301
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:27,981
That was Gerston, Santos, and
who's the other guy?

302
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:30,086
-Petrie.
-Petrie. Right, okay.

303
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:32,950
Well, some people
are gonna be working...

304
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:35,524
...this weekend.

305
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,282
Oh, that's nice.

306
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:14,031
Ross.

307
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:25,540
I'm here.

308
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,712
You are?

309
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:35,883
We were just....

310
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:39,315
What?

311
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,225
-Great. Now I'm having a baby.
-What?

312
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:49,828
I'm having a baby. I'm having a

313
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:53,162
-The phone, the phone.
-I don't have the phone.

314
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:58,403
I'm hurt.

315
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:05,781
Let's go.
