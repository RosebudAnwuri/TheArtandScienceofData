1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,960
Let it go. It's not a big deal.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,880
Not a big deal? It's amazing.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,840
You reach in, there's one maneuver and bam!

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,360
A bra. Right out the sleeve.

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,880
As far as I know,

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,240
guys don't do anything 
that comes close. Right?

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,320
Come on!

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,320
You guys can pee standing up.

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,160
We can? Okay, I'm trying that.

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,840
Know what blows my mind?

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,680
Women can see breasts
anytime they want.

12
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,360
You look down,
and there they are.

13
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,240
How you get any work done
is beyond me.

14
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,800
I don't get how guys can do
so many mean things...

15
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,880
...and not even care.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,520
-Multiple orgasms!
-There you go.

17
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,120
FRIENDS

18
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,800
105 The one with
the east german laundry detergent

19
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,200
Saturday night. The big night!

20
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,920
Date night!
Saturday night. Saturday night!

21
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,480
-No plans, huh?
-Not a one!

22
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,560
Not even breaking up with Janice?

23
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,440
Right, right. Shut up.

24
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,440
Chandler, nobody likes
breaking up with someone.

25
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,080
-You just gotta do it.
-I know. But it's just so hard.

26
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,160
You're sitting there with her.
She has no idea.

27
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,760
You finally get up
the courage to do it.

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,640
There's that awkward moment
when you've handed her the note.

29
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,840
Why do you have to break up with her?

30
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,080
Be a man. Just stop calling.

31
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,240
If you want, I'll do it with you.

32
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,680
She'd feel like
we're ganging up on her.

33
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,440
You dump Janice,
I'll dump Tony.

34
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,040
You're breaking up with Tony?

35
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,840
He's sweet, but it's not fun anymore.

36
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,720
I don't know if it's me or
his hunger strike, I don't know.

37
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,960
Do you want anything else?

38
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:51,000
You had a nutty, chocolate-y,
kind of cake-y, pie thing that

39
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,040
Nothing. I' m fine.

40
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,320
What's wrong? Why so scrunchie?

41
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,280
My father wants to give me
a Mercedes convertible.

42
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,720
That guy, he burns me up.

43
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,880
Yeah, it's a Mercedes
if I move back home.

44
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,920
It was horrible!
He called me "young lady. "

45
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,280
I hate when my father
calls me that.

46
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,600
Did he say
"You' re not up to this" again?

47
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,680
I got the extended version
with choruses of...

48
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,200
... "You'll Never Make it on Your Own. "

49
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,000
Hi, Joey.

50
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,320
Oh, my God! Angela!

51
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,640
Wow! Being dumped
by you agrees with her.

52
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,200
-Are you gonna go over there?
-No.

53
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,800
 Yeah. No.

54
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,320
Okay, but not yet.
I don't wanna seem too eager.

55
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,400
One Mississippi, two Mississippi...

56
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,080
...three Mississippi.
That seems pretty cool.

57
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,480
-Hey, Angela.
-Joey.

58
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,880
You look good.

59
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,520
That's because l' m wearing a dress
that accents my boobs.

60
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,880
You don't say.

61
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,680
So, Rachel, what are you
doing tonight?

62
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,720
Big glamour night.
Me and Monica at Launderama.

63
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,000
You wanna hear a freakish coincidence?

64
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,480
Guess who's doing laundry there too?

65
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,600
-Who?
-Me!

66
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,080
Was that not clear?

67
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,040
Why don't...?

68
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,240
Why don't I just
join you both there?

69
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,320
Don't you have a laundry room
in your building?

70
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,920
Yes. I do have a laundry room
in my building.

71
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,960
But there's a rat problem.

72
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,240
Apparently, they're attracted
to dryer sheets.

73
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,800
They're going in fine,
but they're coming out all...

74
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,440
...fluffy.

75
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,080
-Anyway, 7-ish?

76
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,680
-Sure.

77
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,200
Forget it. I'm with Bob now.

78
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,680
Bob? Who the hell's Bob?

79
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,200
Bob is great.

80
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,480
He's smart, sophisticated, 
and he has a real job.

81
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,440
You go on three auditions a month
and you' re an actor. Bob...

82
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,600
Come on! We were great together.

83
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,520
And not just at the fun stuff,
but, like, talking too.

84
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,960
Sorry, Joey. You said,
" Let's be friends. "

85
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,560
So guess what?

86
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,080
-What?
-We' re just friends.

87
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,680
Fine. Fine.

88
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,520
Why don't the four of us have
dinner tonight? As friends.

89
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,040
What "four of us"?

90
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,080
You and Bob,
and me and my girlfriend...

91
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,240
...Monica.

92
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,240
I' m telling you,
this guy's perfect for you.

93
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,760
Forget it! Not after your cousin
who could belch the alphabet.

94
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,680
Come on, this guy's great.
His name's Bob. He's Angela's...

95
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,960
... brother.

96
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,160
He's smart, he's sophisticated...

97
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,080
...and he has a real job.

98
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,080
I go on three auditions a month
and say l' m an actor, but he's...

99
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,800
-God help us.
-What?

100
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,960
Ugly Naked Guy
is laying kitchen tile.

101
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,400
Look, l' m asking a favor here.

102
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,040
If I do this for her brother,

103
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,040
maybe Angela will come back to me.

104
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,400
What's going on?
You go out with tons of girls.

105
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,520
I know, but...

106
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:38,200
Look, I made a huge mistake.
I never should've broke up with her.

107
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,160
Will you help me? Please?

108
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,960
Monica's not coming.
It's just gonna be me and Rachel.

109
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,160
Hold on, camper.
You've thought this through?

110
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,280
It's laundry.
The thinking-through is minimal.

111
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,560
Just you and Rachel?
Just you two?

112
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,440
This is a date.
You're going on a date.

113
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,440
What are you saying?

114
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,000
I should shave again?
Pick up some wine?

115
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,440
Well, you may wanna rethink
the dirty underwear.

116
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:27,120
It's the first time she'll see
your underwear. You want it dirty?

117
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,080
And the fabric softener?

118
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,880
Okay, now what is wrong
with my Snuggles?

119
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,440
What? It says I'm a sensitive,
warm kind of guy.

120
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,520
You know, like a little fuzzy bear.

121
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,920
-I'll pick something else up.
-There you go.

122
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,840
Thank you.

123
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,560
What does Bob look like?
Is he tall, short?

124
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,960
Yep.

125
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,200
Which?

126
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,840
Which what?

127
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,280
You've never met Bob, have you?

128
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,360
No, but...

129
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,360
For all we know, he's horribly...

130
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,520
Horribly attractive.
I'll be shutting up now.

131
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,000
Where are they?
Where are they?

132
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,800
This is nice. We never
do anything, just the two of us.

133
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:31,280
Great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent
a car, run over some puppies.

134
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,200
I don't wanna do that.

135
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,480
-Here we go.
-Have a good breakup.

136
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,120
-Hey, Janice.
-My God, I am so glad you called me.

137
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,480
I had the most supremely awful day.

138
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,160
That's not good.

139
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,240
Can I get an espresso
and a latte over here?

140
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,280
We got the proofs from the shoot
with the vegetables.

141
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,480
They sucked.

142
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,600
I blew off the afternoon.
I went shopping.

143
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,640
And I got you...

144
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,880
I'm looking. I'm looking.

145
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,600
I' m looking.

146
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,040
-I got you
-What?

147
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,880
-What?
-What did you get me there?

148
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,680
I got you...

149
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,800
...these.

150
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,880
Bullwinkle socks.

151
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,400
-That's sweet.
-I knew you had Rockys.

152
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,640
You can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle

153
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,800
...or wear Rocky and Rocky,
or you can mix and match.

154
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,800
Moose and squirrel.

155
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,320
Whatever you want.

156
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,760
I'm gonna get another espresso.
More latte?

157
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:47,720
No, l' m still working on mine.

158
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,680
That's it?

159
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,480
Yeah, it was really hard.

160
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,960
Yeah, the hug looked pretty brutal.

161
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,880
You weren't there.

162
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,520
Coming through. Move. Move!

163
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,280
Excuse me! I was kind of
using that machine.

164
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,760
Yeah, well, now you' re kind of not.

165
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,760
But I saved it.
I put my basket on top.

166
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,360
I'm sorry.
Is that your basket?

167
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,960
It's pretty.
Unfortunately, I don't see suds!

168
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,800
What?

169
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,560
No suds, no save, okay?

170
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,200
What's going on?

171
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,080
Nothing. This horrible woman
just took my machine.

172
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,720
Was your basket on top?

173
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,080
-Yeah, but there were no suds.
-So?

174
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,760
You know, no suds, no save.

175
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,880
No suds, no... Excuse me.

176
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,600
Hold on a second!

177
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,920
This is my friend's machine.

178
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,240
Hey, hey, hey!
Her stuff wasn't in it!

179
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,800
Hey, hey, hey! That's not
the rule, and you know it!

180
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,360
All right. Show's over.

181
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,320
Nothing to see here.

182
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,200
Okay. Let's do laundry.

183
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,080
That was amazing!
I can't even send back soup.

184
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:37,120
Well, that's because you' re
such a sweet, gentle....

185
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,080
Do you? Do you?
Oh, hey. You must need detergent.

186
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,960
-What's that?
-Uberweiss.

187
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,680
It's new. It's German.
It's extra tough!

188
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,800
Rach, are you gonna separate those?

189
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,760
Oh, God.

190
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,280
Am I being a total laundry spaz?

191
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:06,680
Am I supposed to use one machine
for shirts and another for pants?

192
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,560
Have you never done this before?

193
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,280
Well, not myself.
But I know other people that have.

194
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:20,920
Okay. You caught me.
I'm a laundry virgin.

195
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,480
Don't worry.
I'll use the gentle cycle.

196
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:33,080
Basically, you wanna use
one machine for all your whites.

197
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,480
A whole other machine
for your colors.

198
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,920
And a third for your...

199
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,880
...delicates.
That would be your bras...

200
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,720
...and your underpanty things.

201
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,200
These are white cotton panties.

202
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,200
Would they go with whites
or with delicates?

203
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,920
That would be a judgment call.

204
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,600
He's so cute!

205
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,600
Where did you grow up?

206
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:10,320
-Brooklyn Heights.
-Cleveland.

207
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,240
-How'd that happen?
-My God!

208
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,080
What?

209
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,480
I suddenly had the feeling

210
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,360
I was falling.

211
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,000
But I'm not.

212
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,680
So, you and Angela, huh?

213
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,200
-Yep. Pretty much.
-You' re a lucky man.

214
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,680
Know what I miss most about her?

215
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,880
That cute nibbly noise

216
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,200
she makes when she eats.

217
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,800
Like a happy little squirrel...

218
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,760
...or a weasel.

219
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,320
I never really noticed.

220
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,480
Oh, yeah, yeah. Listen for it.

221
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,640
Monica. Monica is great.

222
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,040
Yeah, she is.

223
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,840
But it's not gonna last.

224
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,160
She's too much for me in bed.

225
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,840
Sexually.

226
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,680
I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.

227
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,160
Yeah, isn't he?

228
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,160
It's great to meet aguy who is 
smart and funny

229
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,640
who's emotionally older than 8.

230
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,720
You know what else?
He's unbelievable in bed!

231
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,640
My brother never even told me
when he lost his virginity.

232
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,880
That's nice.

233
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,280
You can. It's like
pulling off a Band-Aid.

234
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,360
Just do it really fast,
and then the wound is exposed.

235
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,520
Go! Go!

236
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,960
Hi, Janice.

237
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,760
Here we go. I don't think
we should go out anymore.

238
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,320
All right.

239
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,560
Well, there you go.

240
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,840
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

241
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,840
I know this is gonna sound stupid...

242
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,240
...but I feel that if I can do this...

243
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,200
...if I can actually do
my own laundry...

244
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,920
...there isn't anything I can't do.

245
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,360
That does not sound stupid to me.

246
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,560
The first time I had to cook
for myself after Carol left me

247
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:53,120
I'm sorry, that's all the time
we have. Next on Ross....

248
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,520
-Uh-oh.
-What?

249
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,800
Uh-oh...

250
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:00,040
Uh-oh, the laundry's done.

251
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,880
It's a song.

252
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,640
The laundry song we sing.

253
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,800
Uh-oh! The laundry's done

254
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:09,880
What's the matter?

255
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,160
Nothing.

256
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,680
The laundry's done

257
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,960
Come on, show me.

258
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:19,600
It's just that you left a red sock
with your whites, and now...

259
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,000
...everything's kind of pink

260
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,560
Everything's pink?

261
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,640
Except for the red sock,
which is still red.

262
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,280
Don't be upset.
It can happen to anyone.

263
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,320
But it happened to me.

264
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,960
God, I'm gonna look like
a big Marshmallow Peep!

265
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,960
What am I doing?

266
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,200
My father's right!
I can't live on my own.

267
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,280
I can't even do laundry!

268
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,680
Something went wrong

269
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,080
 with Underdog
and they couldn't inflate his head.

270
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,800
So anyway...

271
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,560
...his head is flopping
down Broadway, right?

272
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,760
And I'm thinking

273
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,760
how inappropriate this is.

274
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,320
Something's in my eye. Could we
check it in the light, please?

275
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,400
-Oh, my God!
-What?

276
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,200
Were we at the same table?
It's like...

277
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:28,120
...cocktails in Appalachia.

278
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,760
They' re close.

279
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,480
Close? Her tongue's in his ear.

280
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:40,480
Like you've never got
a little rambunctious with Ross.

281
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,840
Joey, this is sick.
It's disgusting. It's...

282
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,680
... not really true' is it?

283
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,520
Who's to say what's true?

284
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,800
What were you thinking?

285
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,480
l'm not proud of this, okay?

286
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,560
Well, maybe I am a little.

287
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,840
-l' m out of here!
-Wait!

288
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,880
You like him. I want her.

289
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,000
He likes you.

290
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,040
Really?

291
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,800
Yeah. If we put our heads together,
between the two of us...

292
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,520
...we can break them up.

293
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,080
I' m sorry.
I can't believe I did this.

294
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:20,120
I couldn't stop laughing
at your Norman Mailer story.

295
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,320
Waiter? One more plate of
chicken wings over here.

296
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,160
Here's the thing.
We're different.

297
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,480
I'm bing, bing, bing.
You' re boom, boom, boom.

298
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,040
Oh, my God!

299
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,400
I' m so sorry!

300
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,880
¿Te encuentras bien?

301
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,600
It's just my lens. It's my lens.

302
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,720
I'll be right back.

303
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,760
I hit her in the eye!
In the eye!

304
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,360
This is the worst breakup
in the history of the world!

305
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,760
Oh, my God!

306
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,720
How many have you had?

307
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,640
I don't know. A million!

308
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:10,480
Chandler, easy, easy.
Go to your happy place.

309
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,640
-l' m fine, l' m fine.
-All right.

310
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,600
l'm not fine. Here she is.

311
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:20,080
Wait here, okay? Breathe.

312
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,080
How do you do that?

313
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,760
It's like a gift.

314
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,080
We should always break up together.

315
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,880
I'd like that!

316
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,400
The clothes are clean.
That's the important part.

317
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:56,360
I guess. Except everything
looks like jammies now.

318
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,680
I'm sorry.

319
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,760
Excuse me. We had this cart.

320
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,560
I had a 24-inch waist.
You lose things.

321
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,000
Now, come on.
Get out of my way.

322
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,760
I' m sorry. Maybe I wasn't
being clear. This was our cart.

323
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,880
There weren't clothes in it!

324
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,600
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Quit making up rules!

325
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,320
Let go! Come on, it's my cart.

326
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,400
Listen, Mitzi, if you want it...

327
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,560
...you' re gonna have
to take me with it!

328
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,880
Yes! Did you see that?

329
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,240
You were incredible.

330
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,840
A brand-new woman,
ladies and gentlemen.

331
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,840
Thank you. I could not have
done this without you.

332
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,120
More clothes in the dryer?

333
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,320
-I'm fine. I'm fine.
-Are you sure?

334
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,280
-Are you sure you' re okay?
-Yeah.

335
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,920
-Does it still hurt?
-Yeah.

336
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:13,120
What a neat idea! All your
clothes match. I' m gonna do this.

337
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,480
How'd it go?

338
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,720
Excellent!

339
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:22,000
We ripped that couple apart
and kept the pieces for ourselves.

340
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,000
What a beautiful story.

341
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,120
I'm fine, by the way.

342
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,880
I'm sorry.

343
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,000
Where's Chandler?

344
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,920
He needed time to grieve.

345
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,800
I' m free! I' m free!

346
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,320
That ought to do it.
