1
00:00:03,612 --> 00:00:05,045
All right, Phoebe?

2
00:00:05,332 --> 00:00:09,610
If I were omnipotent for a day,
I would want world peace. . .

3
00:00:09,812 --> 00:00:12,770
. . .no more hunger,
good things for the rain forest.

4
00:00:13,812 --> 00:00:15,006
And bigger boobs.

5
00:00:16,532 --> 00:00:18,841
Well, see, you took mine.

6
00:00:20,252 --> 00:00:21,048
What about you?

7
00:00:21,252 --> 00:00:25,040
If I were omnipotent for a day,
I'd make myself omnipotent forever.

8
00:00:25,932 --> 00:00:27,411
There's always one guy. . . .

9
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:30,644
''If I had a wish, I'd wish
for three more wishes. ''

10
00:00:32,812 --> 00:00:34,086
Hey, Joey.

11
00:00:34,372 --> 00:00:36,363
What would you do
if you were omnipotent?

12
00:00:37,092 --> 00:00:38,844
Probably kill myself.

13
00:00:40,412 --> 00:00:41,527
Excuse me?

14
00:00:41,772 --> 00:00:45,162
If little Joey's dead,
then I got no reason to live.

15
00:00:47,252 --> 00:00:49,402
Joey, omnipotent.

16
00:00:50,932 --> 00:00:52,650
You are?

17
00:00:53,092 --> 00:00:54,684
Ross, I'm--

18
00:00:55,052 --> 00:00:57,008
The One With George Stephanopoulos

19
00:00:58,292 --> 00:00:59,281
English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

20
00:01:45,732 --> 00:01:47,450
How does she do that?

21
00:01:47,852 --> 00:01:50,241
I cannot sleep in a public place.

22
00:01:51,012 --> 00:01:52,240
Would you look at her?

23
00:01:52,492 --> 00:01:54,369
She's so peaceful.

24
00:01:56,972 --> 00:01:58,246
What?

25
00:01:59,492 --> 00:02:02,290
It's okay. You just nodded off again.

26
00:02:02,532 --> 00:02:03,567
What's going on?

27
00:02:03,812 --> 00:02:05,131
I got no sleep last night.

28
00:02:05,332 --> 00:02:08,051
My grandmother has
this new boyfriend. . .

29
00:02:09,132 --> 00:02:12,249
. . .and they're both
kind of insecure in bed, so--

30
00:02:12,452 --> 00:02:13,931
And deaf.

31
00:02:15,692 --> 00:02:19,446
They're constantly reassuring
each other they're having a good time.

32
00:02:19,652 --> 00:02:21,643
You have no idea how loud they are.

33
00:02:23,612 --> 00:02:25,250
You can stay with Rachel and me.

34
00:02:25,492 --> 00:02:26,641
Thanks.

35
00:02:26,852 --> 00:02:28,604
--95, 96, 97.

36
00:02:29,052 --> 00:02:32,840
See, I told you. Less than
1 00 steps from our place to here.

37
00:02:33,092 --> 00:02:35,845
You got way too much free time, man.

38
00:02:36,452 --> 00:02:38,647
There's the birthday boy.

39
00:02:39,132 --> 00:02:39,928
Check it out.

40
00:02:40,172 --> 00:02:43,448
Hockey tickets. Rangers-Penguins
tonight and we're taking you.

41
00:02:43,692 --> 00:02:44,602
Happy birthday!

42
00:02:44,852 --> 00:02:46,251
We love you, man.

43
00:02:47,892 --> 00:02:50,452
It's funny. My birthday
was seven months ago.

44
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:53,442
-So?
-I'm guessing you had an extra ticket. . .

45
00:02:53,692 --> 00:02:56,047
. . .and couldn't decide
who got to bring a date?

46
00:02:57,332 --> 00:03:00,051
Well, aren't we
Mr. ''The Glass is Half Empty. ''

47
00:03:01,012 --> 00:03:02,445
Oh, my God!

48
00:03:02,852 --> 00:03:04,683
Is today the 20th?
October 20th?

49
00:03:04,932 --> 00:03:07,048
I was hoping you wouldn't remember.

50
00:03:07,532 --> 00:03:08,851
What's wrong with the 20th?

51
00:03:09,092 --> 00:03:12,243
Eleven days before Halloween?
All the good costumes are gone?

52
00:03:13,492 --> 00:03:16,450
Today's the day Carol and I. . .

53
00:03:17,132 --> 00:03:19,043
. . .first consummated. . .

54
00:03:19,452 --> 00:03:21,443
. . .our physical relationship.

55
00:03:22,812 --> 00:03:24,245
Sex.

56
00:03:27,012 --> 00:03:28,491
I better pass on the game.

57
00:03:28,732 --> 00:03:33,248
I'm just gonna go home and think
about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.

58
00:03:34,532 --> 00:03:37,046
The hell with hockey!
Let's all do that!

59
00:03:38,932 --> 00:03:41,207
Come on, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice!

60
00:03:41,412 --> 00:03:44,609
Guys night out! Come on,
what do you say, big guy? Huh?

61
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:47,442
-What are you doing?
-I have no idea.

62
00:03:48,052 --> 00:03:49,087
Come on, Ross.

63
00:03:49,332 --> 00:03:51,971
All right. Maybe it will
take my mind off it.

64
00:03:52,212 --> 00:03:55,409
-Promise to buy me a big foam finger?
-You got it.

65
00:03:55,772 --> 00:03:56,568
Look, look!

66
00:03:56,772 --> 00:03:58,251
My first paycheck!

67
00:03:58,452 --> 00:03:59,646
Look at the window!

68
00:03:59,892 --> 00:04:02,452
There's my name! Hi, me!

69
00:04:04,092 --> 00:04:06,003
I remember when
I got my first paycheck.

70
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:09,529
There was a cave-in in a mine,
and eight people were killed.

71
00:04:11,532 --> 00:04:12,851
You worked in a mine?

72
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:15,641
No, I worked at a Dairy Queen.
Why?

73
00:04:18,932 --> 00:04:21,492
Isn't this exciting?
I earned this.

74
00:04:21,692 --> 00:04:24,286
I wiped tables for it.
I steamed milk for it.

75
00:04:24,532 --> 00:04:26,045
And it was totally. . .

76
00:04:26,612 --> 00:04:28,250
. . .not worth it.

77
00:04:28,932 --> 00:04:31,571
Who's FICA?
Why's he getting all my money?

78
00:04:33,532 --> 00:04:35,648
I mean, what--?
Chandler, look at that.

79
00:04:37,332 --> 00:04:39,084
This is not that bad.

80
00:04:39,332 --> 00:04:41,368
You're fine for a first job.

81
00:04:42,292 --> 00:04:44,852
You can totally, totally
live on this.

82
00:04:47,812 --> 00:04:50,167
By the way, great service today.

83
00:04:50,412 --> 00:04:51,606
-Terrific!
-Excellent!

84
00:04:54,852 --> 00:04:56,285
Hockey!

85
00:05:07,532 --> 00:05:08,851
Hockey!

86
00:05:11,372 --> 00:05:12,168
Rachel?

87
00:05:14,212 --> 00:05:15,327
Oh, my God!

88
00:05:21,132 --> 00:05:24,044
I swear I've seen birds
do this on Wild Kingdom.

89
00:05:25,332 --> 00:05:27,004
What are you guys doing here?

90
00:05:27,252 --> 00:05:30,483
We were in the city shopping,
and your mom said you work here. . .

91
00:05:30,732 --> 00:05:32,643
. . .and it's true!

92
00:05:34,692 --> 00:05:37,809
Look at you in the apron.
You look like you're in a play.

93
00:05:40,732 --> 00:05:44,042
God, look at you! You are so big!
I can't believe it!

94
00:05:44,292 --> 00:05:46,647
I know, I know!
I'm a duplex.

95
00:05:48,172 --> 00:05:49,810
So what's going on with you?

96
00:05:50,012 --> 00:05:53,163
Guess who my dad's making
partner in his firm?

97
00:05:56,132 --> 00:05:58,646
And while we're on
the subject of news. . . .

98
00:06:01,972 --> 00:06:04,247
Look! I have elbows!

99
00:06:10,012 --> 00:06:11,570
Passes it up to Leetch.

100
00:06:11,812 --> 00:06:14,645
Leetch spots Messier in the crease.
Here's the pass!

101
00:06:16,252 --> 00:06:19,767
We'll take a time-out while Messier
looks at some women's shoes.

102
00:06:20,532 --> 00:06:23,330
Carol was wearing boots
just like those the night. . .

103
00:06:23,572 --> 00:06:25,051
. . .that we first. . . .

104
00:06:25,532 --> 00:06:26,851
You know?

105
00:06:27,092 --> 00:06:28,491
In fact, she. . .

106
00:06:28,732 --> 00:06:30,643
. . .she never took them off.

107
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,241
It's because we--
Sorry.

108
00:06:38,572 --> 00:06:39,368
What?

109
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:40,728
Peach pit.

110
00:06:41,252 --> 00:06:42,162
Yes, bunny?

111
00:06:43,652 --> 00:06:44,687
Peach pit.

112
00:06:44,932 --> 00:06:47,605
-That night, we had--
-Peaches?

113
00:06:47,852 --> 00:06:50,207
Actually, nectarines,
but basically. . . .

114
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:52,681
Could've been a peach.

115
00:06:54,332 --> 00:06:56,163
Then we got dressed. . .

116
00:06:56,412 --> 00:06:58,289
. . .and I walked her to. . .

117
00:06:58,532 --> 00:07:00,443
. . .the bus stop.

118
00:07:01,372 --> 00:07:02,168
I'm fine.

119
00:07:03,132 --> 00:07:05,202
That woman's got
an ass like Carol's.

120
00:07:09,852 --> 00:07:12,446
What? I thought we were
trying to find stuff.

121
00:07:13,692 --> 00:07:16,160
Come on, you guys.
Tell me all the dirt.

122
00:07:17,012 --> 00:07:20,084
The biggest news is still you
dumping Barry at the altar.

123
00:07:22,212 --> 00:07:25,727
All right, let's talk
reality for a second.

124
00:07:25,932 --> 00:07:28,082
-When are you coming home?
-What?

125
00:07:28,292 --> 00:07:29,884
Guys, I'm not.

126
00:07:30,132 --> 00:07:32,282
Come on. This is us.

127
00:07:32,532 --> 00:07:33,885
I'm not.

128
00:07:34,132 --> 00:07:37,442
This is what I'm doing now.
I've got this job.

129
00:07:37,692 --> 00:07:38,568
Waitressing?

130
00:07:39,652 --> 00:07:42,246
I'm not just waitressing.

131
00:07:42,452 --> 00:07:43,851
I mean, I'm. . . .

132
00:07:46,932 --> 00:07:50,163
I write the specials
on the specials board.

133
00:07:50,412 --> 00:07:54,485
And I take the dead flowers
out of the vase.

134
00:07:55,292 --> 00:07:59,285
Sometimes Arturo lets me put the little
chocolate blobbies on the cookies.

135
00:07:59,532 --> 00:08:02,251
Your mom didn't tell us
about the blobbies.

136
00:08:13,172 --> 00:08:14,890
How was it with your friends?

137
00:08:19,092 --> 00:08:22,289
Okay, how would you like
some Tiki-Death punch?

138
00:08:22,532 --> 00:08:23,681
What's that?

139
00:08:23,932 --> 00:08:26,048
-Well, it's rum and--
-Okay.

140
00:08:28,732 --> 00:08:32,008
We thought since Phoebe's staying over
we'd have a slumber party.

141
00:08:32,252 --> 00:08:33,446
We got trashy magazines.

142
00:08:33,692 --> 00:08:35,842
We got cookie dough.
We got Twister.

143
00:08:37,052 --> 00:08:38,451
And I brought Operation.

144
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:42,042
But I lost the tweezers
so we can't operate.

145
00:08:43,132 --> 00:08:45,043
But we can prep the guy.

146
00:08:47,292 --> 00:08:49,362
Rach, it's the VISA-card people.

147
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,648
Oh, God.
Ask them what they want.

148
00:08:51,892 --> 00:08:54,850
Could you please tell me
what this is in reference to?

149
00:08:56,012 --> 00:08:56,808
Yes, hold on.

150
00:08:57,092 --> 00:08:59,526
There's been unusual
activity on your account.

151
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:01,967
But I haven't used my card in weeks.

152
00:09:02,212 --> 00:09:03,850
That is the unusual activity.

153
00:09:05,852 --> 00:09:07,843
They just wanna see if you're okay.

154
00:09:08,132 --> 00:09:09,884
They wanna know if I'm okay?

155
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,692
They wanna know if I'm okay.
Okay, let's see.

156
00:09:12,892 --> 00:09:15,850
Let's see. The FICA guys took
all my money.

157
00:09:16,092 --> 00:09:18,845
Everyone I know is either
getting married or pregnant. . .

158
00:09:19,052 --> 00:09:21,247
. . .or promoted.
And I'm getting coffee.

159
00:09:21,492 --> 00:09:23,483
And it's not even for me!

160
00:09:23,732 --> 00:09:27,168
If that sounds like I'm okay,
then tell them I'm okay. Okay?

161
00:09:30,252 --> 00:09:32,482
Rachel has left the building.

162
00:09:34,132 --> 00:09:35,008
Can you call back?

163
00:09:35,252 --> 00:09:37,288
All right! Come on!

164
00:09:38,132 --> 00:09:40,248
Let's play Twister!

165
00:09:48,692 --> 00:09:50,648
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry.

166
00:09:53,252 --> 00:09:55,846
There was ice there
that night with Carol?

167
00:09:56,052 --> 00:09:59,647
Plastic seats? Four thousand
angry Pittsburgh fans?

168
00:10:00,852 --> 00:10:04,083
I was just saying it looks
like we're not sitting together.

169
00:10:04,332 --> 00:10:07,642
But now that you mention it,
there was ice there that night.

170
00:10:08,612 --> 00:10:11,046
It was the first frost.

171
00:10:11,932 --> 00:10:13,809
Just sit down. Sit.

172
00:10:14,052 --> 00:10:17,488
You should feel great. You're doing
this amazing independent thing.

173
00:10:17,732 --> 00:10:19,643
Monica, what is so amazing?

174
00:10:19,892 --> 00:10:24,090
I gave up, like, everything.
And for what?

175
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,811
You are just like Jack.

176
00:10:26,452 --> 00:10:27,680
Jack from downstairs?

177
00:10:28,292 --> 00:10:30,647
No, Jack and the Beanstalk.

178
00:10:31,612 --> 00:10:33,170
Ah, the other Jack.

179
00:10:34,212 --> 00:10:35,565
See, he gave up something. . .

180
00:10:35,772 --> 00:10:37,649
. . .but he got those magic beans.

181
00:10:37,892 --> 00:10:39,371
Then he woke up and there was. . .

182
00:10:39,612 --> 00:10:41,842
. . .this big plant. . .

183
00:10:42,052 --> 00:10:45,283
. . .outside of his window,
full of possibilities and stuff.

184
00:10:45,532 --> 00:10:49,047
And he lived in a village,
and you live in the Village.

185
00:10:49,492 --> 00:10:52,848
Okay, but Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow.

186
00:10:53,092 --> 00:10:55,083
I gave up an orthodontist.

187
00:10:55,332 --> 00:10:57,607
Okay, I know I didn't love him. . . .

188
00:10:57,852 --> 00:11:00,047
See, Jack did love the cow.

189
00:11:00,932 --> 00:11:03,651
But, see, it was a plan.
It was clear.

190
00:11:03,892 --> 00:11:06,929
Everything was figured out
and now everything's like. . . .

191
00:11:07,132 --> 00:11:08,451
''Flupie''?

192
00:11:10,412 --> 00:11:13,165
You're not the only one.
We don't know where we're going.

193
00:11:13,412 --> 00:11:15,880
At some point, it's all
gonna come together. . .

194
00:11:16,132 --> 00:11:18,771
. . .and it's just gonna be ''un-flupie. ''

195
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,525
Yeah, like that's a word.

196
00:11:23,732 --> 00:11:26,929
Okay, but, Monica, what if
it doesn't come together?

197
00:11:31,452 --> 00:11:34,808
Well, because you just--
I don't like this question.

198
00:11:35,932 --> 00:11:39,288
See, you guys? What if we
don't get magic beans?

199
00:11:39,492 --> 00:11:41,642
I mean, what if all we've got are. . .

200
00:11:42,252 --> 00:11:43,844
. . .beans.

201
00:11:47,492 --> 00:11:48,561
Get him!

202
00:11:48,812 --> 00:11:50,245
Get him! Get him!

203
00:11:50,892 --> 00:11:53,850
Yes! You're not laughing now,
are you, pal?

204
00:11:54,092 --> 00:11:57,402
All you need are toothless guys
hitting each other with sticks.

205
00:11:57,612 --> 00:11:59,842
Pass it! Pass it!

206
00:12:00,092 --> 00:12:01,081
He's open!

207
00:12:01,332 --> 00:12:02,811
Shoot it!

208
00:12:09,332 --> 00:12:10,845
We're on that TV thing.

209
00:12:26,132 --> 00:12:27,451
Excuse me?

210
00:12:27,932 --> 00:12:32,050
It says to call if you're not completely
satisfied with this candy bar.

211
00:12:35,972 --> 00:12:38,645
Well, I'm not completely satisfied.

212
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:40,971
It's kind of an emergency.

213
00:12:41,212 --> 00:12:43,521
You know that, or we'd be
in the predicament room.

214
00:12:46,452 --> 00:12:47,567
Hold on.

215
00:12:47,812 --> 00:12:49,564
Fill these out. Sit over there!

216
00:12:49,812 --> 00:12:51,643
I don't wanna make any trouble.

217
00:12:51,892 --> 00:12:56,124
But I'm in a lot of pain here,
all right? My face is dented.

218
00:12:56,372 --> 00:12:58,010
You'll have to wait your turn.

219
00:12:58,252 --> 00:12:59,446
How long will it be?

220
00:13:00,852 --> 00:13:02,843
Any minute now.

221
00:13:18,532 --> 00:13:22,764
I'm so sorry, you guys.
I didn't mean to bring you down.

222
00:13:23,012 --> 00:13:24,843
No, you were right.

223
00:13:25,452 --> 00:13:27,443
I don't have a plan.

224
00:13:30,132 --> 00:13:31,247
Pizza guy!

225
00:13:31,492 --> 00:13:33,050
-Thank God.
-Food!

226
00:13:33,332 --> 00:13:35,368
-Phoebe?
-What?

227
00:13:35,612 --> 00:13:37,250
Do you have a plan?

228
00:13:37,492 --> 00:13:39,244
I don't even have a ''pla. ''

229
00:13:42,132 --> 00:13:44,282
One mushroom, green pepper and onion?

230
00:13:46,732 --> 00:13:48,290
That's not what we ordered!

231
00:13:48,532 --> 00:13:52,047
We ordered a fat-free crust
with extra cheese!

232
00:13:55,052 --> 00:13:57,441
Wait. You're not G. Stephanopolous?

233
00:13:57,652 --> 00:13:59,324
Oh, man.
My dad's gonna kill me!

234
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:00,482
Wait!

235
00:14:00,732 --> 00:14:02,085
Did you say. . .

236
00:14:02,332 --> 00:14:03,890
. . .G. Stephanopolous?

237
00:14:04,132 --> 00:14:06,692
It goes across the street.
I gave him yours.

238
00:14:06,932 --> 00:14:08,888
Bonehead! Bonehead!

239
00:14:09,612 --> 00:14:14,288
Was this a small Mediterranean guy
with curiously intelligent good looks?

240
00:14:15,132 --> 00:14:16,485
That sounds about right.

241
00:14:16,732 --> 00:14:19,087
Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?

242
00:14:19,332 --> 00:14:20,606
And a power tie?

243
00:14:21,412 --> 00:14:23,084
No, pretty much just a towel.

244
00:14:23,412 --> 00:14:24,845
Oh, God!

245
00:14:26,092 --> 00:14:27,207
Want me to take this back?

246
00:14:27,452 --> 00:14:31,127
Are you nuts? We've got
George Stephanopolous' pizza!

247
00:14:37,292 --> 00:14:38,691
Who's George Snuffleupagus?

248
00:14:41,292 --> 00:14:42,611
That's Big Bird's friend.

249
00:14:45,772 --> 00:14:46,682
I see pizza!

250
00:14:46,932 --> 00:14:48,888
I wanna see. Let me see.

251
00:14:49,132 --> 00:14:51,009
Hello! Who are we spying on?

252
00:14:51,252 --> 00:14:54,244
You know, the White House adviser?
Clinton's campaign guy.

253
00:14:54,492 --> 00:14:57,689
The one with the great hair,
sexy smile, really cute butt.

254
00:14:57,932 --> 00:15:01,447
Oh, him! The little guy.
Oh, I love him!

255
00:15:02,612 --> 00:15:04,887
Wait. Wait, I see a woman.

256
00:15:05,132 --> 00:15:07,043
Tell me it's his mother.

257
00:15:07,292 --> 00:15:09,852
-Definitely not his mother.
-Oh, no!

258
00:15:10,052 --> 00:15:11,963
She's walking across the floor.

259
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:14,772
She's walking, she's walking.

260
00:15:15,012 --> 00:15:18,448
She's going for the pizza.
Hey, that's not for you, bitch!

261
00:15:32,652 --> 00:15:33,448
Excuse me?

262
00:15:33,692 --> 00:15:37,401
We've been here for over an hour,
and people less sick have gone in.

263
00:15:37,612 --> 00:15:40,684
That guy with the toe thing?
Who's he sleeping with?

264
00:15:43,852 --> 00:15:46,412
Oh, come on, Dora.
Don't be mad.

265
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,046
I know we both said some things. . .

266
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:51,686
. . .we didn't mean. . .

267
00:15:51,932 --> 00:15:54,651
. . .but that doesn't mean
we still don't love each other.

268
00:15:55,452 --> 00:15:57,966
You know, I feel like I've lost her.

269
00:16:01,812 --> 00:16:03,245
Lights still out?

270
00:16:04,292 --> 00:16:06,044
Maybe they're napping.

271
00:16:06,652 --> 00:16:08,483
Please. They're having sex.

272
00:16:08,732 --> 00:16:10,085
Shut up!

273
00:16:15,332 --> 00:16:18,290
So what do you think George is like?

274
00:16:18,532 --> 00:16:20,045
I think he's shy.

275
00:16:21,332 --> 00:16:23,448
I think you have to draw him out.

276
00:16:23,652 --> 00:16:25,131
And then when you do. . .

277
00:16:25,372 --> 00:16:27,442
. . .he's a preppy animal.

278
00:16:32,132 --> 00:16:34,088
I remember the moonlight came in. . .

279
00:16:34,332 --> 00:16:37,165
. . .through the open window,
and her face had the most. . .

280
00:16:37,412 --> 00:16:38,686
. . .incredible glow.

281
00:16:38,932 --> 00:16:42,083
Yes, the moon, the glow,
the magical feeling.

282
00:16:42,332 --> 00:16:45,847
You did this part. Could I get
some painkillers over here, please?

283
00:16:46,892 --> 00:16:50,407
He's right, enough already.
What is the big deal about today?

284
00:16:50,612 --> 00:16:52,364
So you slept with her
for the first time.

285
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:55,684
So what? You slept with her
for seven years after that.

286
00:16:57,132 --> 00:16:59,282
It's a little more complicated
than that.

287
00:16:59,532 --> 00:17:04,162
Is it that she left you? That she
left you for a woman that likes women?

288
00:17:04,412 --> 00:17:08,564
Louder. There's a man on the 1 2th
floor in a coma who didn't hear you.

289
00:17:12,092 --> 00:17:13,127
Then what?

290
00:17:14,212 --> 00:17:16,248
My first time with Carol was. . .

291
00:17:17,052 --> 00:17:18,246
. . .was my. . . .

292
00:17:20,292 --> 00:17:21,486
What?

293
00:17:23,892 --> 00:17:26,087
It was my first. . .

294
00:17:26,732 --> 00:17:28,051
. . .time.

295
00:17:29,092 --> 00:17:29,922
With Carol?

296
00:17:37,412 --> 00:17:40,643
So in your whole life,
you've only been with one. . .?

297
00:17:42,332 --> 00:17:45,449
Oh, boy. Hockey was a big mistake.

298
00:17:46,612 --> 00:17:48,807
There's a lot of stuff
we could've done tonight.

299
00:17:51,452 --> 00:17:52,885
Okay, I got one.

300
00:17:53,932 --> 00:17:56,685
Do you remember that vegetarian pâté. . .

301
00:17:56,932 --> 00:17:59,446
. . .that I made that you loved so much?

302
00:18:00,932 --> 00:18:03,844
Well, unless goose is a vegetable!

303
00:18:07,452 --> 00:18:11,411
Okay, fine. Now I don't feel so bad
about sleeping with Jason Hurley.

304
00:18:11,892 --> 00:18:13,723
What? You slept with Jason?

305
00:18:13,972 --> 00:18:15,405
You'd already broken up.

306
00:18:15,652 --> 00:18:16,846
How long?

307
00:18:17,092 --> 00:18:17,968
A couple hours.

308
00:18:18,292 --> 00:18:20,089
Oh, that's nice!

309
00:18:20,292 --> 00:18:22,248
Okay, okay, I got one!

310
00:18:24,612 --> 00:18:25,488
Anyway. . . .

311
00:18:25,732 --> 00:18:29,327
The valentine Tom left
in your locker was really from me!

312
00:18:29,932 --> 00:18:30,921
Excuse me?

313
00:18:31,932 --> 00:18:35,083
Hello! Like he was really
gonna send you one.

314
00:18:37,452 --> 00:18:39,488
She was a big girl!

315
00:18:41,332 --> 00:18:43,766
Really? Well, at least. . .

316
00:18:44,012 --> 00:18:47,243
. . .big girls don't pee in
their pants in seventh grade!

317
00:18:47,492 --> 00:18:50,086
I was laughing. You made me laugh!

318
00:18:50,332 --> 00:18:52,482
Oh, my God! There he is!
There he is!

319
00:18:53,012 --> 00:18:55,845
-Where?
-Where we've been looking all night.

320
00:18:56,492 --> 00:18:59,450
-Oh, he's so cute.
-George, baby, drop the towel.

321
00:18:59,652 --> 00:19:01,449
Come on, drop the towel.

322
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:13,442
Man, can you believe he's
only had sex with one woman?

323
00:19:14,452 --> 00:19:15,851
I think it's great.

324
00:19:16,132 --> 00:19:17,804
You know, it's sweet.

325
00:19:18,332 --> 00:19:20,050
It's romantic.

326
00:19:21,252 --> 00:19:22,048
Really?

327
00:19:22,292 --> 00:19:25,250
No, you kidding? The guy's a freak.
I judge him.

328
00:19:25,732 --> 00:19:27,245
Hey, buddy!

329
00:19:32,692 --> 00:19:34,284
That's attractive.

330
00:19:36,292 --> 00:19:39,045
I thought you were great
in Silence of the Lambs.

331
00:19:41,532 --> 00:19:44,649
Admit it, all things considered,
you had fun tonight.

332
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:48,521
Where was the fun? Tell me specifically
which part was the fun part?

333
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:50,603
Where's my puck?

334
00:19:50,852 --> 00:19:52,649
-The kid has it.
-The kid?

335
00:19:54,052 --> 00:19:56,486
Excuse me, that's my puck.

336
00:19:56,732 --> 00:20:00,168
I found it. Finders keepers,
losers weepers.

337
00:20:03,532 --> 00:20:05,250
You gotta do it, man.

338
00:20:06,452 --> 00:20:09,250
Oh, yeah? I'm rubber, you're glue.
Whatever you--

339
00:20:09,492 --> 00:20:10,845
I can't do it.

340
00:20:11,532 --> 00:20:14,251
Listen, give me back my puck.

341
00:20:14,732 --> 00:20:15,642
Yes, how about it.

342
00:20:15,892 --> 00:20:18,087
Come here.
Give me my puck.

343
00:20:18,332 --> 00:20:19,890
No roughhousing in my ER!

344
00:20:20,132 --> 00:20:21,485
Give me my puck!

345
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,648
Now that was fun.

346
00:20:37,132 --> 00:20:39,566
Right foot, red.

347
00:20:39,932 --> 00:20:42,844
Could've played Monopoly, but no!

348
00:20:49,092 --> 00:20:50,241
Thanks.

349
00:20:57,932 --> 00:20:59,081
Right hand, blue.

350
00:21:01,732 --> 00:21:03,051
Good.

351
00:21:10,532 --> 00:21:12,204
It's the VISA-card people.

352
00:21:12,612 --> 00:21:14,125
Will you take my place?

353
00:21:14,412 --> 00:21:16,209
All right. Yes, this is Rachel.

354
00:21:21,332 --> 00:21:24,881
No, I know. I haven't been
using it much.

355
00:21:25,092 --> 00:21:28,482
Well, thanks.
But I'm okay, really.

356
00:21:28,772 --> 00:21:30,046
To the green.

357
00:21:31,412 --> 00:21:33,448
I've got magic beans.

358
00:21:35,892 --> 00:21:37,291
No, never mind.

359
00:21:37,532 --> 00:21:39,045
To the left! To the left!

360
00:21:41,412 --> 00:21:43,050
I'm fine.
