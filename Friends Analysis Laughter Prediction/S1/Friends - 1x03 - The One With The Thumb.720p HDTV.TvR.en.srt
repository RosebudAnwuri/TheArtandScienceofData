1
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,320
Hi guys!
Hey, Pheebs!

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:06,760
Oh, oh, how'd it go?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,800
Um, not so good.

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,920
He walked me to the subway and said
'We should do this again!'
Ohh. Ouch.

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,800
What?
He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,880
Uh, no. Loosely translated
'We should do this again' means

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,000
'You will never see me naked'.

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,480
Since when?

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,840
Since always.
It's like dating language.

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,240
Y'know, like
'It's not you' means 'It is you'.

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,120
Or 'You're such a nice guy' means
'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics

12
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,920
and complaining about them to you'.

13
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,680
Or, or, y'know, um,
'I think we should see other people'

14
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,480
'Ha, ha, I already am'.

15
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,840
And everybody knows this?

16
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,160
Yeah. Cushions the blow.

17
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,640
Yeah, it's like when you're a kid,
and your parents put your dog to sleep,

18
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,080
and they tell you it
went off to live on some farm.

19
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,480
That's funny, that, no, because,
uh, our parents actually did,

20
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,160
uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.

21
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,320
Uh, Ross.

22
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,880
What? Wh- hello?
The Millners' farm in Connecticut?

23
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,360
The Millners, they had
this unbelievable farm,

24
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,000
they had horses, and,
and rabbits that he could

25
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,080
chase and it was- it w- .....

26
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,280
Oh my God, Chi Chi!

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,800
FRIENDS

28
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:10,401
"So how does it feel knowing
you're about to die?"

29
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:13,895
"Warden, in five minutes
my pain will be over.

30
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:19,650
But you'll have to live with the knowledge
that you sent an honest man to die."

31
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,808
Hey, that was really good!

32
00:02:22,048 --> 00:02:23,846
Thanks! Let's keep going.

33
00:02:24,086 --> 00:02:29,322
Okay.
"So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"

34
00:02:30,281 --> 00:02:34,038
"I just wanna go back to my cell.
'Cause in my cell, I can smoke."

35
00:02:34,277 --> 00:02:36,635
"Smoke away."

36
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:52,822
I think this is probably why
 Damone smokes in his cell alone.

37
00:02:53,061 --> 00:02:54,900
What?
Relax your hand!

38
00:02:57,058 --> 00:02:59,416
Not so much!

39
00:03:00,215 --> 00:03:02,413
Alright, now try taking a puff.

40
00:03:02,653 --> 00:03:05,651
Alright..

41
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:06,690
Okay.
No. Give it to me.

42
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,128
No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.

43
00:03:09,367 --> 00:03:13,044
It's fine, it's fine. Look,
do you wanna get this part, or not?

44
00:03:13,284 --> 00:03:16,162
Here.
Don't think of it as a cigarette..

45
00:03:16,401 --> 00:03:20,718
Think of it as the thing that's
been missing from your hand.

46
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:23,156
When you're holding it, you feel right.

47
00:03:23,395 --> 00:03:24,554
You feel complete.

48
00:03:24,794 --> 00:03:25,674
Y'miss it?

49
00:03:25,913 --> 00:03:28,831
Nah, not so much.

50
00:03:29,031 --> 00:03:32,628
Alright, now we smoke.

51
00:03:33,827 --> 00:03:37,583
Oh.. my.. God.

52
00:03:44,977 --> 00:03:48,254
They say it's the same as the distance from

53
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:52,171
the tip of a guy's thumb
to the tip of his index finger.

54
00:03:56,287 --> 00:03:59,085
That's ridiculous!

55
00:03:59,325 --> 00:04:02,282
Can I use.. either thumb?

56
00:04:02,802 --> 00:04:05,480
Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me!

57
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:10,196
Decaf cappucino for Joey..

58
00:04:10,355 --> 00:04:12,873
Coffee black..

59
00:04:13,113 --> 00:04:15,711
Late...

60
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,469
And an iced tea.

61
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:19,028
I'm getting pretty good at this!

62
00:04:19,268 --> 00:04:20,986
Yeah. Yeah, excellent.

63
00:04:21,226 --> 00:04:23,904
Good for me!

64
00:04:35,774 --> 00:04:36,573
Y'okay, Phoebe?

65
00:04:36,813 --> 00:04:38,292
Yeah... no... I'm just... it's, I haven't worked...

66
00:04:38,531 --> 00:04:39,890
It's my bank.

67
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,128
What did they do to you?

68
00:04:42,368 --> 00:04:46,125
It's nothing, it's just... Okay.
I'm going through my mail,

69
00:04:46,365 --> 00:04:48,963
and I open up their monthly, you know,
STATEMENT... Easy.

70
00:04:49,562 --> 00:04:52,440
...and there's five hundred
extra dollars in my account.

71
00:04:52,679 --> 00:04:55,757
Oh, Satan's minions at work again...

72
00:04:55,997 --> 00:04:58,395
Yes, 'cause now I have to go
down there, and deal with them.

73
00:04:58,634 --> 00:05:00,353
What are you talking about?
Keep it!

74
00:05:00,593 --> 00:05:01,632
It's not mine, I didn't earn it,

75
00:05:01,872 --> 00:05:04,389
if I kept it, it would be like stealing.

76
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:09,465
Yeah, but if you spent it,
it would be like shopping!

77
00:05:10,464 --> 00:05:12,423
Okay. Okay, let's say I bought
a really great pair of shoes.

78
00:05:12,662 --> 00:05:14,781
Do you know what I'd hear,
with every step I took?

79
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,498
'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.'

80
00:05:17,738 --> 00:05:20,296
And even if I was happy,
okay, and, and skipping...

81
00:05:20,536 --> 00:05:23,533
'Not... not... mine, not... not... mine,
not... not... mine, not... not... mine'...

82
00:05:23,773 --> 00:05:26,251
We're with you. We got it.

83
00:05:26,491 --> 00:05:30,367
Okay. I'd... just... I'd never be able to enjoy it.
It would be like this giant karmic debt.

84
00:05:30,607 --> 00:05:32,805
Chandler, what are you doing?

85
00:05:33,045 --> 00:05:36,122
Hey. Whaddya doing?

86
00:05:37,641 --> 00:05:40,039
Oh! Oh, God!

87
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,198
What is this?!

88
00:05:41,438 --> 00:05:42,637
I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking.

89
00:05:42,877 --> 00:05:45,235
Oh, I can't believe you!
You've been so good, for three years!

90
00:05:45,474 --> 00:05:48,991
And this... is my reward!

91
00:05:49,231 --> 00:05:52,428
Hold on a second, alright?
Just think about what you went
through the last time you quit.

92
00:05:52,668 --> 00:05:55,026
Okay, so this time I won't quit!

93
00:05:55,266 --> 00:05:57,944
Ohhh! Put it out!

94
00:05:58,184 --> 00:05:59,622
All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out.

95
00:05:59,862 --> 00:06:03,299
Oh, no! I... I can't drink this now!

96
00:06:05,697 --> 00:06:07,735
Alright. I'm gonna go change,
I've got a date.

97
00:06:07,975 --> 00:06:10,293
This Alan again? How's it goin'?

98
00:06:10,533 --> 00:06:14,450
'S'going pretty good, y'know?
It's nice, and, we're having fun.

99
00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:16,408
So when do we get to meet the guy?

100
00:06:16,648 --> 00:06:18,406
Let's see, today's Monday...

101
00:06:18,646 --> 00:06:20,245
Never.

102
00:06:20,285 --> 00:06:21,963
Oh, come on! Come on!
No. Not after what happened with Steve.

103
00:06:22,603 --> 00:06:23,562
What are you talking about?

104
00:06:23,802 --> 00:06:28,398
We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!..

105
00:06:29,877 --> 00:06:30,716
Sorry.

106
00:06:30,956 --> 00:06:33,913
Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet.
Just give me a chance to figure that out.

107
00:06:34,153 --> 00:06:36,671
Well, then can we meet him?

108
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:40,268
Nope. Schhorry.

109
00:06:42,226 --> 00:06:43,705
I mean, why should I let them meet him?

110
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:47,142
and within five minutes they're all over him.

111
00:06:47,382 --> 00:06:50,939
I mean, they're like... coyotes,
picking off the weak members of the herd.

112
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:55,415
Listen. As someone who's seen
more than her fair share of bad beef,

113
00:06:55,655 --> 00:06:59,212
I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing.

114
00:06:59,451 --> 00:07:01,809
I mean, they're your friends,
they're just looking out after you.

115
00:07:02,049 --> 00:07:05,206
I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring
a guy home that they actually liked.

116
00:07:05,446 --> 00:07:08,883
Well, you do realise the odds of that happening
are a little slimmer

117
00:07:09,123 --> 00:07:12,520
if they never get to meet the guy...

118
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,199
Let it go, Ross.

119
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:17,636
Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.

120
00:07:20,114 --> 00:07:21,193
Do you all promise?

121
00:07:21,433 --> 00:07:23,950
Yeah! We promise! We'll be good!

122
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:28,427
Chandler? Do you promise to be good?

123
00:07:34,422 --> 00:07:39,857
You can come in,
but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!

124
00:07:45,404 --> 00:07:47,404
Hey, Pheebs.

125
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:48,889
'Dear Ms. Buffay.

126
00:07:49,129 --> 00:07:50,648
Thank you for calling attention to our error.

127
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:54,884
We have credited your account
with five hundred dollars.

128
00:07:55,124 --> 00:07:59,400
We're sorry for the inconvenence,
and hope you'll accept this football phone

129
00:08:00,999 --> 00:08:02,917
as our free gift.'
Do you believe this?!

130
00:08:03,157 --> 00:08:07,713
Now I have a thousand dollars,
and a football phone!

131
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:10,751
What bank is this?

132
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,387
Hey. It's him.

133
00:08:14,587 --> 00:08:15,626
 Who is it?
It's Alan.

134
00:08:15,866 --> 00:08:18,944
Chandler! He's here!

135
00:08:20,462 --> 00:08:22,740
Okay, please be good, please.

136
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:26,977
Just remember how much you all like me.

137
00:08:27,896 --> 00:08:31,813
Hi.
Alan, this is everybody.
Everybody, this is Alan.

138
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:39,366
I've heard schho much about all you guyschh!

139
00:08:44,802 --> 00:08:47,959
Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow.

140
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:54,114
Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin.

141
00:08:54,353 --> 00:08:57,591
Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm?

142
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,709
C'mon!

143
00:08:59,949 --> 00:09:02,746
...I'll go.

144
00:09:03,905 --> 00:09:06,303
Let's start with the way
he kept picking at...

145
00:09:06,543 --> 00:09:07,862
no, I'm sorry,

146
00:09:08,102 --> 00:09:09,461
I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him.

147
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,899
Loved him! Yeah! He's great!

148
00:09:11,139 --> 00:09:12,178
Wait a minute!

149
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:15,416
We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?
Yeah!

150
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:18,913
And did you notice...?
Yeah.

151
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:24,967
Know what was great?
The way his smile was kinda crooked.

152
00:09:25,207 --> 00:09:27,605
Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!

153
00:09:27,845 --> 00:09:30,043
...What shoe?

154
00:09:30,283 --> 00:09:31,562
From the nursery rhyme.

155
00:09:31,801 --> 00:09:33,880
'There was a crooked man,
Who had a crooked smile,

156
00:09:34,119 --> 00:09:38,156
Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'

157
00:09:39,595 --> 00:09:41,833
...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against

158
00:09:42,073 --> 00:09:45,989
which all future boyfriends will be measured.

159
00:09:46,229 --> 00:09:47,348
What future boyfriends?

160
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:50,625
Nono, I th... I think this could be, y'know, it.
Really!

161
00:09:50,865 --> 00:09:54,662
Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his
David Hasselhof impression alone.

162
00:09:54,902 --> 00:09:58,659
You know I'm gonna be
doing that at parties, right?

163
00:10:00,977 --> 00:10:03,934
You know what I like most about him, though?
What?

164
00:10:04,174 --> 00:10:08,890
The way he makes me feel about myself.
Yeah...

165
00:10:28,313 --> 00:10:30,431
Hi... how was the game?

166
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,110
Well...

167
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:35,187
WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!

168
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:39,024
Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?

169
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,382
Alan.
He was unbelievable.

170
00:10:41,622 --> 00:10:45,019
e was like that...that... that Bugs Bunny
cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions,

171
00:10:45,259 --> 00:10:50,015
right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan,
second base-Alan, third base-...

172
00:10:52,053 --> 00:10:55,410
I mean, it...it was like,
it was like he made us into a team.

173
00:10:55,650 --> 00:11:01,445
Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewelers
a thing or two about softball..

174
00:11:01,445 --> 00:11:03,004
Can I ask you guys a question?

175
00:11:03,244 --> 00:11:05,602
D'you ever think that Alan is maybe... sometimes...

176
00:11:05,841 --> 00:11:06,761
What?

177
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,478
...I dunno, a little too Alan?

178
00:11:09,718 --> 00:11:13,035
Well, no. That's impossible.
You can never be too Alan.

179
00:11:13,275 --> 00:11:17,791
Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness
that... that... that we adore.

180
00:11:18,031 --> 00:11:21,628
I personally could have a gallon of Alan.

181
00:11:25,904 --> 00:11:26,903
Hey, Lizzie.

182
00:11:27,143 --> 00:11:28,422
Hey, Weird Girl.

183
00:11:28,662 --> 00:11:31,499
I brought you alphabet soup.
Did you pick out the vowels?

184
00:11:31,739 --> 00:11:35,576
Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, "sometimes y".

185
00:11:35,816 --> 00:11:36,895
Uh, I also have something else for you.

186
00:11:37,135 --> 00:11:38,094
Saltines?

187
00:11:38,334 --> 00:11:40,851
No, but would you like a
thousand dollars and a football phone?

188
00:11:41,091 --> 00:11:43,249
What?

189
00:11:43,489 --> 00:11:45,008
Oh my God,

190
00:11:45,248 --> 00:11:47,885
there's really money in here.
I know.

191
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,644
Weird Girl, what are you doing?

192
00:11:49,884 --> 00:11:52,721
No, I want you to have it.
I don't want it.

193
00:11:52,961 --> 00:11:54,720
No, no, I ha...
I have to give you something.

194
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,478
Oh, that's fine, no.

195
00:11:56,718 --> 00:11:58,556
Would you like my tin-foil hat?

196
00:11:58,796 --> 00:12:01,474
No. 'Cause you need that.
No, it's okay, thanks.

197
00:12:01,714 --> 00:12:04,072
Please, let me do something.

198
00:12:04,311 --> 00:12:09,707
Okay, alright, you buy me a soda,
and then we're even. Okay?
Okay.

199
00:13:09,816 --> 00:13:11,814
Okay.
Keep the change.

200
00:13:12,054 --> 00:13:12,893
Thanks, Lizzie.

201
00:13:13,133 --> 00:13:14,292
Sure you don't wanna pretzel?

202
00:13:14,532 --> 00:13:18,928
No, I'm fine.
See ya.

203
00:13:24,923 --> 00:13:27,501
Huh!
A thumb?!

204
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,398
I know! I know,
I opened it up and there it was,

205
00:13:30,638 --> 00:13:35,234
just floating in there,
like this tiny little hitch-hiker!

206
00:13:35,634 --> 00:13:39,630
Well, maybe it's a contest,
y'know? Like, collect all five?

207
00:13:40,589 --> 00:13:41,788
Does, um, anyone wanna see?

208
00:13:42,028 --> 00:13:44,786
Nooo!

209
00:13:45,185 --> 00:13:46,664
Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!

210
00:13:46,904 --> 00:13:49,742
It's worse than the thumb!

211
00:13:50,461 --> 00:13:51,740
Hey, this is so unfair!

212
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,299
Oh, why is it unfair?

213
00:13:53,538 --> 00:13:56,136
So I have a flaw! Big deal!

214
00:13:56,376 --> 00:13:58,894
Like Joey's constant
knuckle-cracking isn't annoying?

215
00:13:59,134 --> 00:14:01,172
And Ross, with his over-pronouncing
every single word?

216
00:14:01,412 --> 00:14:03,610
And Monica, with that snort
when she laughs?

217
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:07,447
I mean, what the hell is that thing?

218
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:12,242
I accept all those flaws,
why can't you accept me for this?

219
00:14:17,678 --> 00:14:22,274
Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?

220
00:14:24,552 --> 00:14:27,709
Well, I... I could live without it.

221
00:14:28,988 --> 00:14:34,863
Well, is it, like, a little annoying,
or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?

222
00:14:36,222 --> 00:14:39,219
Oh, now, don't listen to him,
Pheebs, I think it's endearing.

223
00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:43,056
Oh, "you do, do you"?

224
00:14:47,532 --> 00:14:50,530
You know, there's nothing
wrong with speaking correctly.

225
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:54,846
"Indeed there isn't"...

226
00:14:55,406 --> 00:14:57,124
I should really get back to work.

227
00:14:57,364 --> 00:15:02,040
Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone
might get what they actually ordered.

228
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:07,196
The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.

229
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:24,101
Did you ever go out with a
guy your friends all really like?

230
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:26,579
No.

231
00:15:26,739 --> 00:15:31,895
Okay... Well, I'm going out with a guy
my friends all really like.

232
00:15:32,134 --> 00:15:34,532
Wait... wait... we talking
about the coyotes here?

233
00:15:34,772 --> 00:15:38,729
All right, a cow got through!

234
00:15:38,968 --> 00:15:40,287
Can you believe it?

235
00:15:40,527 --> 00:15:42,046
...Y'know what?

236
00:15:42,286 --> 00:15:44,923
I just don't feel the thing.

237
00:15:45,163 --> 00:15:47,641
I mean, they feel the thing,

238
00:15:47,881 --> 00:15:50,159
I don't feel the thing.

239
00:15:50,498 --> 00:15:53,916
Honey... you should always feel the thing.

240
00:15:54,915 --> 00:15:57,952
Listen, if that's how you feel
about the guy, Monica, dump him!

241
00:15:58,192 --> 00:15:59,751
I know... it's gonna be really hard.

242
00:15:59,991 --> 00:16:01,749
Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it.

243
00:16:01,989 --> 00:16:06,825
No, he'll be fine.
It's the other five I'm worried about.

244
00:16:07,065 --> 00:16:08,663
Do you have any respect for your body?

245
00:16:08,903 --> 00:16:10,901
Don't you realise what
you're-you're doing to yourself?

246
00:16:11,141 --> 00:16:13,059
Hey, y'know, I have had it with
you guys and your cancer

247
00:16:13,299 --> 00:16:15,058
and your emphysema and your heart disease.

248
00:16:15,298 --> 00:16:20,133
The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.

249
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,330
Chandler? It's Alan,
he wants to speak to you.

250
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:27,767
Really? He does?

251
00:16:27,807 --> 00:16:31,164
Hey, buddy, what's up!

252
00:16:31,444 --> 00:16:34,201
Oh, she told you about that, huh.

253
00:16:34,441 --> 00:16:38,917
Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now.

254
00:16:39,157 --> 00:16:42,155
Well, it's not that big...

255
00:16:42,834 --> 00:16:46,111
well, that's true...

256
00:16:46,911 --> 00:16:50,907
Gee, y'know, no-one...
no-one's ever put it like that before.

257
00:16:51,147 --> 00:16:54,504
Well, okay, thanks!

258
00:17:02,937 --> 00:17:05,455
God, he's good.

259
00:17:05,695 --> 00:17:08,572
If only he were a woman.
Yeah.

260
00:17:14,127 --> 00:17:15,486
Ooh, Lambchop.

261
00:17:15,726 --> 00:17:18,883
How old is that sock?

262
00:17:19,123 --> 00:17:24,279
If I had a sock on my hand for
thirty years it'd be talking too.

263
00:17:24,399 --> 00:17:30,314
Okay. I think it's time to
change somebody's nicotine patch.

264
00:17:32,632 --> 00:17:33,431
Hey. Where's Joey?

265
00:17:33,671 --> 00:17:38,027
Joey ate my last stick of gum,
so I killed him.

266
00:17:38,067 --> 00:17:41,504
Do you think that was wrong?

267
00:17:41,584 --> 00:17:44,382
I think he's across the hall.

268
00:17:44,701 --> 00:17:46,660
Thanks.
There y'go.

269
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,857
Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.

270
00:17:50,097 --> 00:17:54,493
Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?...
Pheebs?

271
00:17:54,693 --> 00:17:58,689
Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart?

272
00:17:58,889 --> 00:18:01,047
Hey, I might!

273
00:18:01,287 --> 00:18:03,046
Sorry...

274
00:18:03,285 --> 00:18:08,121
Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me
seven thousand dollars for the thumb.

275
00:18:08,181 --> 00:18:08,718
You're kidding.
Oh my God.

276
00:18:12,543 --> 00:18:12,597
And on my way over here,
I stepped in gum.

277
00:18:12,598 --> 00:18:14,716
...What is up with the universe?!

278
00:18:14,956 --> 00:18:15,875
What's going on?

279
00:18:16,115 --> 00:18:18,632
Nothing.
I just think it's nice when we're all here together.

280
00:18:18,872 --> 00:18:23,468
Even nicer when everyone
gets to wear their underwear...

281
00:18:32,301 --> 00:18:34,019
Uh, Joey... Oh, God! Okay...
Oh! That was Lambchop!

282
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:35,058
Please, guys, we have to talk.

283
00:18:35,298 --> 00:18:36,977
Wait, wait, I'm getting a deja vu...

284
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:39,814
No, I'm not.

285
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:42,052
Alright, we have to talk.

286
00:18:42,292 --> 00:18:44,650
There it is!

287
00:18:46,369 --> 00:18:48,727
Okay. It's-it's about Alan.

288
00:18:48,967 --> 00:18:52,404
There's something that you should know.

289
00:18:52,444 --> 00:18:57,040
I mean, there's really
no easy way to say this...

290
00:18:57,239 --> 00:19:01,076
uh... I've decided to break up with Alan.

291
00:19:04,034 --> 00:19:07,231
Is there somebody else?

292
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:10,109
No, nononono... it's just... things change.

293
00:19:10,348 --> 00:19:13,186
People change.

294
00:19:13,426 --> 00:19:17,023
We didn't change..

295
00:19:17,742 --> 00:19:21,099
So that's it? It's over?

296
00:19:21,259 --> 00:19:23,377
Just like that?

297
00:19:23,617 --> 00:19:29,772
You know.. you let your guard down,
you start to really care about someone,
and I just... I...

298
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:35,527
Look, I... I could go on pretending...
Okay!

299
00:19:35,767 --> 00:19:38,684
...but that wouldn't be fair to me,
it wouldn't be fair to Alan...
It wouldn't be fair to you!

300
00:19:38,924 --> 00:19:40,882
Who... who wants fair?

301
00:19:41,122 --> 00:19:46,198
Y'know, I just want things back.
Y'know, the way they were.

302
00:19:46,597 --> 00:19:47,397
I'm sorry...

303
00:19:47,637 --> 00:19:51,993
Oh, she's sorry!
I feel better!

304
00:19:52,193 --> 00:19:53,552
I just can't believe this!

305
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:59,227
I mean, with the holidays coming up...
I wanted him to meet my family...

306
00:19:59,466 --> 00:20:02,304
I'll meet somone else.
There'll be other Alans.

307
00:20:02,544 --> 00:20:05,062
Oh, yeah! Right!

308
00:20:08,259 --> 00:20:09,858
Are you guys gonna be okay?

309
00:20:10,097 --> 00:20:11,656
Hey hey, we'll be fine.

310
00:20:11,896 --> 00:20:14,933
We're just gonna need a little time.

311
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:18,370
I understand.

312
00:20:23,086 --> 00:20:24,205
Wow.
I'm, I'm really sorry.

313
00:20:24,445 --> 00:20:27,443
Yeah, I'm sorry too.

314
00:20:27,682 --> 00:20:29,681
But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.

315
00:20:29,921 --> 00:20:30,880
Relieved?

316
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:34,636
Yeah, well, I had a great time with you...

317
00:20:34,876 --> 00:20:38,713
I just can't stand your friends.

318
00:20:43,949 --> 00:20:48,704
Remember when we went to Central Park
and rented boats?

319
00:20:49,264 --> 00:20:52,142
That was fun.

320
00:20:52,241 --> 00:20:56,138
Yeah.
He could row like a viking.

321
00:20:57,872 --> 00:21:00,194
Hi.
Mmm.

322
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:05,050
So how'd it go?

323
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:06,249
Oh, y'know..

324
00:21:06,889 --> 00:21:10,126
Did he mention us?

325
00:21:13,843 --> 00:21:17,920
He said he's really gonna miss you guys.

326
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:23,875
You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere.

327
00:21:29,629 --> 00:21:32,747
...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
No no no!

328
00:21:32,987 --> 00:21:33,866
I don't care, I don't care! Game's over!

329
00:21:34,106 --> 00:21:37,023
I'm weak! I've gotta smoke!
I've gotta have the smoke!

330
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:40,660
If you never smoke again
I'll give you seven thousand dollars!

331
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,897
Yeah, alright.

00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
