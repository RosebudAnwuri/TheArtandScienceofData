The One Where It All Began (Pilot)

2
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:59,256
There's nothing to tell.
It's just some guy I work with.

3
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:01,586
You're going out with the guy.

4
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:04,389
There has to be something
wrong with him.

5
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:06,656
All right, Joey.
Be nice.

6
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:09,358
So does he have a hump
and a hairpiece?

7
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:13,605
Wait, does he eat chalk?

8
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:17,072
I don't want her to go through
what I did with Carl.

9
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:21,339
Okay, everybody relax.
This is not even a date.

10
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:25,883
It's just two people going out
to dinner and not having sex.

11
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:29,213
Sounds like a date to me.

12
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:33,491
I'm in high school,
in the cafeteria..

13
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,891
and I realize I'm totally naked.

14
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,758
I've had that dream.

15
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,757
Then I look down and I realize
there is a phone..

16
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,197
there.

17
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:49,704
- Instead of
- That's right!

18
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,441
Never had that one.

19
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:56,207
All of a sudden,
the phone starts to ring.

20
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:59,408
What do I do?
Everyone starts looking at me.

21
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,179
They weren't looking at you before?

22
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:06,922
Finally, I figure
I'd better answer it.

23
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,927
And it turns out it's my mother.

24
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:15,090
Which is very, very weird
because she never calls me.

25
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,604
Hi.

26
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:27,472
He says, "Hello,"
I want to kill myself.

27
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:29,639
You okay?

28
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:35,214
I feel like someone pulled my
intestine out of my mouth..

29
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:39,858
- and tied it around my neck.
- Cookie?

30
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,954
Carol moved her stuff out today.

31
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:46,394
- Let me get you some coffee.
- Thanks.

32
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:54,866
No, don't!
Stop cleansing my aura.

33
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:59,704
- Just leave my aura alone, okay?
- Fine, be murky.

34
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:03,674
- I'll be fine. I hope she'll be happy.
- No, you don't.

35
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:07,284
No, I don't.
To hell with her. She left me!

36
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:10,251
You never knew she was a lesbian?

37
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:15,584
No! Okay?

38
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,797
Why does everyone
keep fixating on that?

39
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:23,893
She didn't know.
How should I know?

40
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:28,897
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.

41
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:31,670
Did I say that out loud?

42
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:37,747
I told Mom and Dad last night.
They took it pretty well.

43
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:38,940
Oh, really?

44
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:42,781
So that hysterical phone call
from a woman sobbing..

45
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:47,619
"I'll never have grandchildren,"
was what? A wrong number?

46
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,849
Sorry.

47
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,862
Look, you're feeling
a lot of pain right now.

48
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,694
You're angry.
You're hurting.

49
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,132
Can I tell you what
the answer is?

50
00:03:58,304 --> 00:03:59,601
Strip joints!

51
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,141
Hey, you're single.
Have some hormones.

52
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:07,541
But I don't want
to be single, okay?

53
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:11,274
I just want to be married again.

54
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:19,084
And I just want a million dollars!

55
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:26,426
- Rachel?
- Oh, Monica! Thank God!

56
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,664
I went to your building..

57
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:32,601
and a guy with a hammer
said you'd be here, and you are.

58
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:36,674
- Can I get you some coffee?
- Decaf.

59
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:40,744
Everybody, this is Rachel,
a Lincoln High survivor.

60
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,541
This is everybody.
Chandler and Phoebe..

61
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:45,911
Joey.
Remember my brother, Ross?

62
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,313
Sure!

63
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:01,894
You want to tell us now, or are we
waiting for four wet bridesmaids?

64
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:07,903
Well, it started about
a half-hour before the wedding.

65
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:10,769
I was in the room
with all the presents..

66
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:16,677
and I was looking at this
really gorgeous Limoges gravy boat.

67
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,510
When all of a sudden

68
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:19,912
Sweet 'N Low?

69
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:26,190
I realized I was more turned on by
this gravy boat than Barry.

70
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:29,259
I got freaked out,
and it hit me:

71
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:32,260
How much Barry looks
like Mr. Potato Head.

72
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:36,368
I always knew
he looked familiar, but..

73
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:42,139
I had to get out of there,
and I started wondering..

74
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:46,005
"Why am I doing this,"
and "Who am I doing it for?"

75
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:50,114
I didn't know where to go,
and I know we've drifted apart..

76
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:53,616
but you're the only person
I know here.

77
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:59,156
- Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
- I hoped that wouldn't be an issue.

78
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:20,544
I guess he bought her the pipe organ,
and she's really not happy about it.

79
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,774
"Tuna or egg salad!
Decide!"

80
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:30,017
"I'll have whatever
Christina's having."

81
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,522
Daddy, I just
I can't marry him.

82
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:38,929
I'm sorry.
I just don't love him.

83
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:43,159
Well, it matters to me!

84
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:50,300
"If I let go of my hair,
my head will fall off."

85
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,802
She should not be
wearing those pants.

86
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:56,675
Push her down the stairs!

87
00:06:57,183 --> 00:07:00,050
Push her!
Push her down the stairs!

88
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:06,951
Come on, Daddy, listen!

89
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,792
All my life, everyone's
always told me, "You're a shoe!"

90
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:14,432
"You're a shoe!"

91
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,626
What if I don't want to be a shoe?

92
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,896
What if I want to be a purse?

93
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,735
Or a hat?

94
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:26,476
No, I don't want you
to buy me a hat!

95
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:29,977
It's a metaphor, Daddy!

96
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:34,074
You can see where he'd have trouble.

97
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:37,719
Look, Daddy,
it's my life.

98
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:42,653
Well, maybe I'll just stay
here with Monica.

99
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:48,097
I guess we've established
she's staying with Monica.

100
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:51,899
Well, maybe that's my decision.

101
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:54,299
Maybe I don't need your money.

102
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:57,707
Wait!
I said maybe!

103
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:07,784
Just breathe. That's it.

104
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:10,445
Try to think of nice, calm things.

105
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:14,248
Raindrops on roses
And whiskers on kittens

106
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:18,858
Doorbells and sleigh bells
And something with mittens

107
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:23,396
La la la something
And noodles with string

108
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:25,665
I'm all better now.

109
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:30,100
I helped.

110
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,710
This is probably for the best.

111
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:39,144
Independence. Controlling your life.
The whole hat thing.

112
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:43,448
You can always come to Joey.

113
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:47,251
Me and Chandler live across the hall.
He's away a lot.

114
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:51,723
Stop hitting on her!
It's her wedding day.

115
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:55,261
Like there's a rule, or something?

116
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,702
I got it.

117
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:03,431
Please don't do that again.
It's a horrible sound.

118
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,267
It's Paul.

119
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:08,936
Oh, God, is it 6:30?
Buzz him in.

120
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:11,583
- Who's Paul?
- Paul, the wine guy?

121
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:12,773
Maybe.

122
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:16,285
Your "not a real date"
is with Paul, the wine guy?

123
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:18,946
- He finally asked you out?
- Yes!

124
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:21,626
It's a "Dear Diary" moment.

125
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:25,263
- Rach, I can cancel.
- Please, go, I'll be fine.

126
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:30,067
Ross, are you okay?
Do you want me to stay?

127
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:32,965
That'd be good.

128
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:38,199
- Really?- Go on! It's Paul, the wine guy!

129
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:41,008
Does he sell it, drink it?

130
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:43,977
Or he just complains a lot?

131
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:46,515
Hi, come in!
Paul, this is..

132
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,245
everybody.
Everybody, this is Paul.

133
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:55,792
- The wine guy.
- I didn't catch your name. Paul?

134
00:09:57,496 --> 00:10:00,624
I'll be right back.
I've just gotta go

135
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,199
A-wandering?

136
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:04,733
Change.

137
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,371
Sit down.
Two seconds.

138
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:15,577
I just pulled out four eyelashes.
That can't be good.

139
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,752
Hey, Paul, here's a tip.

140
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:26,517
She really likes it when you
rub her neck in the same spot..

141
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:29,559
until it starts to get red.

142
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:33,095
Shut up, Joey!

143
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,726
What are you up to tonight?

144
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:40,233
I was supposed to be headed
for Aruba on my honeymoon..

145
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:42,838
so, nothing.

146
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:47,270
Right. You're not even
getting your honeymoon.

147
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:50,415
Although, Aruba.
This time of year?

148
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,948
Talk about your..

149
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:56,584
big lizards.

150
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:01,955
If you don't want
to be alone tonight..

151
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:05,689
Joey and Chandler are
helping me with my furniture.

152
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:08,298
We're very excited about it.

153
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:11,731
Thanks. But I'm just
going to hang out here.

154
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:13,996
- It's been a long day.
- Oh, sure.

155
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,568
Phoebe, wanna help?

156
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:19,705
I wish I could,
but I don't want to.

157
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:33,681
Love is sweet as summer showers
Love is a wondrous work of art

158
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:39,657
But your love
Oh, your love, your love

159
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:44,268
Is like a giant pigeon

160
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:48,133
Crapping on my heart

161
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:52,509
Thank you.

162
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:05,317
I'm supposed to attach a bracket-y
thing to the side things..

163
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:08,322
using a bunch of these
little worm guys.

164
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:14,324
I have no bracket-y thing.
I see no worm guys whatsoever..

165
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:17,331
and I cannot feel my legs.

166
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,537
- We got a bookcase.
- It's beautiful.

167
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,442
What's this?

168
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:31,675
I would have to say
that is an L-shaped bracket.

169
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:36,147
- Which goes where?
- I have no idea.

170
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,321
- Done with the bookcase.
- All finished.

171
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:47,691
This was Carol's favorite beer.

172
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:52,536
She always drank it out of the can.
I should have known.

173
00:12:55,975 --> 00:13:01,174
- Start with that, we're out of here.
- Please don't spoil all this fun.

174
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,779
Let me ask you.

175
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:07,316
She got the furniture,
the stereo, the good TV.

176
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,351
What did you get?

177
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:12,649
- You guys.
- You got screwed.

178
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:17,421
- Oh, my God.
- I know. I'm such an idiot.

179
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:22,192
I should've known when she went to
the dentist five times a week.

180
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:24,733
I mean, how clean can teeth get?

181
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:27,269
My brother's going through that.

182
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,997
How did you get over it?

183
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:32,733
He might accidentally
break something valuable of hers.

184
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,539
- Say her
- Leg?

185
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:38,649
That's one way of doing it.
I went for the watch.

186
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:41,810
You actually broke her watch?

187
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:46,253
The worst I ever did was shred
my old boyfriend's favorite towel.

188
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:50,019
- Steer clear of you.
- That's right.

189
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:53,598
Barry, I'm sorry.
I am so sorry.

190
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:59,236
You probably think it's about making
love with your socks on, but it isn't.

191
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:02,236
It's about me.
And I just

192
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:11,807
The machine cut me off again.
Anyway..

193
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:21,649
I know that some lucky girl is going
to become Mrs. Barry Finkel.

194
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:25,592
But it isn't me.
It's not me.

195
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:30,235
Not that I have any idea who "me" is
right now, but you just

196
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,263
I'm divorced.

197
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:40,605
- I'm only 26, and I'm divorced!
- Shut up!

198
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,617
That only took me an hour.

199
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:54,856
We haven't had a relationship
that's lasted longer than a Mento.

200
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:59,962
You have had the love of a woman
for four years.

201
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:05,467
Four years of closeness and sharing,
after which she ripped your heart out.

202
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:08,663
That is why we don't do it!

203
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:13,011
I don't think that was my point!

204
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:17,342
Know what's scary? What if there's
only one woman for everybody?

205
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:20,677
I mean, what if you get one
woman, and that's it?

206
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:25,823
Unfortunately, in my case,
there was only one woman for her.

207
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:31,092
What are you talking about?
One woman.

208
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:35,291
That's like saying there's only
one flavor of ice cream.

209
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:39,631
Let me tell you something.
There's lots of flavors out there.

210
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:43,901
Rocky road and cookie dough
and bing cherry vanilla.

211
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:49,043
You can get them with jimmies
or nuts or whipped cream.

212
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:52,075
It's the best thing
to happen to you!

213
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:56,118
You got married.
You were like, what, 8?

214
00:15:57,022 --> 00:16:00,924
Welcome back to the world.
Grab a spoon!

215
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:05,492
- I don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
- Then stay out of my freezer.

216
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:12,796
Ever since she walked out on me..

217
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,239
What?

218
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:17,875
You wanna spell it out with noodles?

219
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:22,810
It's more of a fifth date
kind of revelation.

220
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:27,509
So there's going to be
a fifth date?

221
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:29,313
Isn't there?

222
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:31,751
Yeah, yeah.
I think there is.

223
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:36,724
What were you going to say?

224
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:43,395
Ever since she left me..

225
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:46,367
I haven't been able to perform..

226
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:48,903
sexually.

227
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:54,111
Oh, God!
I'm so sorry.

228
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:58,716
Being spit on is probably
not what you need right now.

229
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:01,719
How long?

230
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,014
- Two years.
- Wow.

231
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:09,092
I'm glad you smashed her watch.

232
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:14,989
So you still think you might
want that fifth date?

233
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:20,734
Yeah.
Yeah, I do.

234
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:26,108
We are gathered here
to join Joanie Louise Cunningham..

235
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:31,647
and Charles.
Chachi, Chachi, Chachi..

236
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:36,480
in the bonds of holy matrimony.

237
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:37,780
See!

238
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:43,986
But Joanie loved Chachi.
That's the difference.

239
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:46,694
"Grab a spoon."

240
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,232
Do you know how long it's been
since I grabbed a spoon?

241
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:54,938
Do the words, "Billy, don't be
a hero," mean anything to you?

242
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:01,638
Great story.
But I gotta go.

243
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:06,682
I got a date with Andrea.
Angela. No, Andrea.

244
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:10,286
Andrea's the screamer.
Angela has cats.

245
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:15,120
Right, thanks. It's Julie.
I'm out of here.

246
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:20,995
Here's the thing. Even if
I could get it together enough..

247
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,827
to ask a woman out..

248
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:25,697
who am I going to ask?

249
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:53,624
Isn't this amazing?
I've never made coffee in my life.

250
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:56,331
- That is amazing.
- Congratulations.

251
00:18:56,702 --> 00:19:00,433
If I can make coffee,
there isn't anything I can't do.

252
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:06,170
I think it's, "If I can invade Poland,
there's nothing I can't do."

253
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:11,009
If you feel like you have to make
a Western omelet or something..

254
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:17,410
Although, actually
I'm really not that hungry.

255
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:22,060
Oh, good.
Lenny and Squiggy are here.

256
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:24,620
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

257
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:28,498
- Morning.
- Morning, Paul.

258
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,667
- Hello, Paul.
- Hi. Paul, is it?

259
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,679
- Thank you so much.
- Stop.

260
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:46,375
Last night was like
all my birthdays, both graduations..

261
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:49,110
plus the barn-raising scene
in Witness.

262
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,426
We'll talk later.

263
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:03,428
Thank you.

264
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:13,808
That wasn't a real date.

265
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:17,243
What the hell do you do
on a real date?

266
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:21,275
Shut up and put my table back.

267
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:23,854
I've got to get to work.

268
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:29,551
If I don't input those numbers,
it doesn't make much of a difference.

269
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:35,192
So, like, you guys all have jobs?

270
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:40,997
Yeah, we all have jobs.
That's how we buy stuff.

271
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:47,271
- Yeah, I'm an actor.
- Have I seen you in anything?

272
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:49,812
I doubt it.
Mostly regional work.

273
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:53,473
Unless you saw the Wee One's
production of Pinocchio..

274
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:56,483
at the little theater
in the park?

275
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:58,219
It was a job!

276
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,218
"Look, Geppetto.
I'm a real live boy."

277
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:07,762
- I will not take this abuse.
- You're right, I'm sorry.

278
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:10,695
Once I was a wooden boy
A little wooden boy

279
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:17,336
You should both know
that he's a dead man.

280
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:19,477
Oh, Chandler!

281
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:24,211
How are you doing today?
Sleep okay?

282
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:28,318
Did you talk to Barry?
I can't stop smiling.

283
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:33,048
I see that. You look like you
slept with a hanger in your mouth.

284
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:40,857
I know.
He's just so..

285
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:44,096
- Remember you and Tony Demarco?
- Oh, yeah.

286
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:48,034
Well, it's like that.
With feelings.

287
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:51,876
- Wow, are you in trouble!
- Big time!

288
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:55,642
Want a wedding dress?
Hardly used.

289
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:59,408
I think we're getting a little
ahead of ourselves.

290
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:04,248
I'm going to get up, go to work,
and not think about him all day.

291
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:08,091
Or else I'm going to get up
and go to work.

292
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:09,954
- Wish me luck!
- What for?

293
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:14,531
I'm gonna go get one
of those job things.

294
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,144
- Hi, Monica.
- Franny, welcome back.

295
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:30,542
- How was Florida?
- You had sex, didn't you?

296
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:34,814
- How do you do that?
- I hate you.

297
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:39,013
I'm pushing my aunt through
Parrot Jungle, you're having sex.

298
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:42,354
So, who?

299
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:44,218
You know Paul?

300
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:47,863
Paul, the wine guy?
Yeah, I know Paul.

301
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:52,927
You mean, you know Paul
like I know Paul?

302
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:55,198
What?
I take credit for Paul.

303
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:59,707
Before me, there was no snap in his
turtle for two years.

304
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:05,541
Of course it was a line.

305
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:08,614
Why would anybody
do something like that?

306
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:12,052
I assume we want an answer
more sophisticated than:

307
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:15,159
"To get you into bed."

308
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,692
I hate men.

309
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:21,993
Don't hate. You don't want
to put that out into the universe.

310
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,631
Is it me?

311
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:27,531
Is it like I have some sort of
beacon that only dogs..

312
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:30,402
and men with emotional problems
can hear?

313
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:33,874
Come here.
Give me your feet.

314
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:43,110
I just thought he was nice, you know?

315
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:50,419
I can't believe
you didn't know it was a line.

316
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:55,697
- Guess what?
- You got a job?

317
00:23:55,867 --> 00:24:00,167
Are you kidding?
I'm trained for nothing.

318
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:04,398
- I was laughed out of 12 interviews.
- You're surprisingly upbeat.

319
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:07,841
You'd be too,
if you found these boots on sale..

320
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:10,037
50% off.

321
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:13,275
How well you know me.

322
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:16,944
They're my
"I don't need a job..

323
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:19,214
I've got great boots" boots.

324
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,820
- How did you pay?
- Credit card.

325
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:26,023
And who pays for that?

326
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,028
My father.

327
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:35,330
Is this really necessary?
I can stop charging any time.

328
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,770
You can't live off your parents.

329
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:41,707
I know that.
That's why I was getting married.

330
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:45,508
Give her a break.
It's hard being on your own.

331
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,739
Thank you.

332
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:50,445
I remember when I first
came to this city, I was 14.

333
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:53,522
Mom had killed herself,
stepdad was in jail.

334
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:55,750
I didn't know anybody here.

335
00:24:55,961 --> 00:25:00,557
I ended up living with this albino
guy who was cleaning windshields.

336
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:02,562
And then he killed himself.

337
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:07,431
Then I found aromatherapy.
So I know exactly how you feel.

338
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:13,336
The word you're looking for is:

339
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,446
"Anyway.."

340
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:24,218
- You ready?
- No, how can I be ready?

341
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:27,290
"Ready to jump out of the plane
with no parachute?"

342
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:29,689
- I can't do this.
- I know you can.

343
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:32,989
- No.
- You made coffee, you can do anything.

344
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:38,502
Cut. Cut. Cut.

345
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:47,169
You know what?
I think we can leave it at that.

346
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:51,440
- Kind of a symbolic gesture.
- Rachel, that was a library card.

347
00:25:58,123 --> 00:26:02,992
If you listen closely, you can hear
a thousand retailers scream.

348
00:26:06,197 --> 00:26:07,858
Welcome to the real world!

349
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:11,297
It sucks.
You're gonna love it.

350
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:22,270
That's it.
Are you going to crash on the couch?

351
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:26,611
- No, I gotta go home sometime.
- Are you gonna be okay?

352
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,753
Look what I just
found on the floor.

353
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:34,181
What?

354
00:26:34,392 --> 00:26:38,123
That's Paul's watch.
Just put it back where you found it.

355
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:41,959
Oh, boy!
All right.

356
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,733
- Good night, everybody.
- Good night.

357
00:26:55,780 --> 00:27:00,683
- I'm sorry. Have it, I don't want it.
- Split it?

358
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:08,381
You probably didn't know this,
but in high school..

359
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,251
I had a major crush on you.

360
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:13,929
I knew.

361
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:17,159
You did?

362
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:20,962
I figured you thought
I was Monica's geeky brother.

363
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:23,231
I did.

364
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:29,471
Listen, do you think..?

365
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:34,675
Try not to let my vulnerability
become a factor here.

366
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:39,450
Do you think it would be okay
if I asked you out sometime?

367
00:27:40,358 --> 00:27:42,519
Yeah.

368
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:44,058
Maybe.

369
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:48,262
Okay.

370
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,604
Okay, maybe I will.

371
00:27:57,942 --> 00:28:01,343
- Good night.
- Good night.

372
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:16,656
See you.

373
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:20,453
Wait, wait.
What's with you?

374
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:27,368
I just grabbed a spoon.

375
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:37,642
- I can't believe what I'm hearing.
- Can't believe what I'm hearing

376
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:40,046
- What? I said
-  What? I said

377
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:43,577
- Would you stop?
- Was I doing it again?

378
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:46,053
Yes!

379
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:50,794
I said you had a nice butt.
It's just not a great butt.

380
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:55,194
- You won't know a butt if it bit you.
- There's an image.

381
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:00,934
Would anybody like more coffee?

382
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:04,136
You made it,
or you're serving it?

383
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:07,937
- I'm just serving it.
- I'll have a cup of coffee.

384
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:09,613
Kids, new dream.

385
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:11,043
I'm in Las Vegas.

386
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:13,844
Miss, more coffee?

387
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:17,983
Could you give this
to that guy over there?

388
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:21,320
Go ahead.
Thank you.

389
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:24,256
Sorry.
Okay, Las Vegas.

390
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:26,555
I'm in Las Vegas.

391
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:29,831
I'm Liza Minnelli..
