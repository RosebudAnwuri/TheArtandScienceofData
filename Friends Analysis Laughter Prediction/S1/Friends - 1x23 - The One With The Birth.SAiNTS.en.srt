1
00:00:06,973 --> 00:00:10,204
She's having my baby,
and she's not here yet.

2
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,277
-Has her water broken yet?
-I don't know.

3
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:17,882
When we talked, she said she'd
already passed the mucous plug.

4
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,113
Do we have to know about that?

5
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,055
What'll you do
when you have a baby?

6
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:28,659
I'll be in the waiting room,
handing out cigars.

7
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:33,831
Joey's made arrangements to have
his baby in a movie from the '50s.

8
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:37,928
She could be giving birth in the cab.

9
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:41,471
Relax. It's only $2
for the first contraction...

10
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:45,939
...and then 50 cents for each
additional contraction.

11
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:49,513
What, it's okay
when Chandler does it?

12
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,378
You have to pick your moments.

13
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,217
Did I miss it?

14
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:57,288
-She's not here yet.
-What's with the guitar?

15
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:01,551
We might be here for a while.
Things might get musical.

16
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:05,555
-Where have you been?
-We stopped at the gift shop.

17
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:08,062
I got this,
and Susan wanted a Chunky.

18
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:12,465
You're having a baby.
You don't stop for Chunkies.

19
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:15,605
I used to have that bumper sticker.

20
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,472
You see what I mean?

21
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:21,242
The One With the Birth

22
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:08,893
-"Stopped for a Chunky."
-Let it go, Ross.

23
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:11,120
I got an extra one.
You want this?

24
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,832
-How's my favorite parenting team?
-Dr. Franzblau.

25
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:22,007
I understand you're thinking
of having a baby.

26
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:26,144
I see you're nine months pregnant.
That's a good start.

27
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,805
-How are your contractions?
-I love them.

28
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:33,452
Each one's like a little party
in my uterus.

29
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:37,919
-Every 4 minutes, lasting 55 seconds.
-59 seconds. Quartz.

30
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:40,119
Swiss quartz.

31
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:45,420
-Am I allowed to drink anything?
-lce chips.

32
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,157
-At the nurse's station.
-I'll get it!

33
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:51,132
-No, I'll get it.
-No, I'm getting it.

34
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:55,739
Hi. Thought you might like
some ice chips.

35
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:59,539
-Thanks.
-And if you need anything else l...

36
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:01,611
...do not believe we've met.

37
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,582
I'm Rachel Greene.

38
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:08,082
I'm Carol's ex-husband's
sister's roommate.

39
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:11,022
Nice to meet you.
I'm Dr. Franzblau.

40
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:16,058
I'm your roommate's brother's
ex-wife's obstetrician.

41
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:18,188
Oh, that's funny.

42
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:27,099
I want a baby.

43
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:30,743
Not tonight, honey.
I got an early day tomorrow.

44
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:35,711
-Get up. Let's get some coffee.
-Okay, because we never do that.

45
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:41,216
Shoot, shoot, shoot.
Or just fall down. That's good too.

46
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,382
Knick fan?

47
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,856
-Oh, boy, do they suck.
-Listen, lady

48
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,761
Look. Look at your man, Ewing.

49
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:55,332
He couldn't hit water
if he was standing on a boat.

50
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:58,136
-And who do you like?
-Celtics.

51
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:01,569
Celtics? They couldn't hit a boat if

52
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:03,639
Wait....

53
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:06,737
They suck, all right?

54
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,446
Shut up.
It's a rebuilding year

55
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:14,947
Let me get the father.
We need a father over here.

56
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,019
There's no father.

57
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:22,921
-Oh, sorry.
-That's okay. I'm fine.

58
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,360
Okay. Right this way.

59
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:30,433
All the other pregnant women
seem to be going in here.

60
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:40,137
They're tiny and chubby
And so sweet to touch

61
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,043
But soon they'll grow up
And resent you so much

62
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:50,012
Now they're yelling at you
And you don 't know why

63
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:54,159
And you cry and you cry
And you cry

64
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,523
And you cry and you cry
And you cry

65
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:01,063
-Thanks, Ross.
-I'm paying you to stop.

66
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:07,305
Oh, look, twins.
Hi, guys. Oh, cute.

67
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:09,700
No fair.

68
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:12,673
I don't even have one.
How come they get two?

69
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,507
-You'll get one.
-When?

70
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:20,685
Tell you what. When we're 40,
if neither of us are married...

71
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:22,787
...what do you say we have one?

72
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:26,049
Why won't I be married
when I'm 40?

73
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,159
I just meant hypothetically.

74
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:32,422
Hypothetically, why won't I be
married when I'm 40?

75
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:37,426
What is it? Is there something
unmarriable about me?

76
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:39,761
Well?

77
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:43,099
Dear God!
This parachute is a knapsack.

78
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:49,877
Look at you, dressy-dress.

79
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:51,910
Did you go home and change?

80
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:55,814
It's an important day.
I want to look nice.

81
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:58,281
Has Dr. Franzblau been by?

82
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:01,020
I haven't seen him.

83
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,956
Where is he?
He is supposed to be here.

84
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,299
What if the baby needs him?

85
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:12,971
What's the deal with you and doctors?
Is your father a doctor?

86
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:14,434
Yeah. Why?

87
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:17,175
No reason.

88
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:21,141
Mom, we've been through this.

89
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:23,907
No, I am not calling him.

90
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:27,311
I don't care if it is his kid,
the guy's a jerk.

91
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,081
No, I am not alone.
Joey's here.

92
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:33,820
What do you mean "Joey who"?

93
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:35,253
Joey who?

94
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:38,588
-Tribbiani.
-Joey Tribbiani.

95
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:43,625
Yes. Okay. Hold on.

96
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,929
She wants to talk to you.

97
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:47,996
Take the phone.

98
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:50,674
Yeah, it's me.

99
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,504
No, we're just friends.

100
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:56,940
Yeah, I'm single.

101
00:06:57,784 --> 00:06:59,046
Twenty-five.

102
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:02,711
An actor. Hello?

103
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:10,218
She's not much of a phone person.

104
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:14,126
So, what's the deal
with this father guy?

105
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:18,235
If someone was having my baby,
I'd wanna know about it.

106
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:23,532
Hey, Knick fan, am I interested
in your views on fatherhood? No.

107
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:29,339
-Maybe I should just go.
-Maybe you should.

108
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:31,209
Good luck...

109
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,116
...and take care.

110
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:43,723
The Celtics problem is that
the players run the team.

111
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:47,091
-That is so not true.
-Oh, it is.

112
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,164
-Breathe.
-Breathe.

113
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:51,597
You're gonna kill me.

114
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:56,268
-Fifteen more seconds. 1 4, 1 3, 1 2
-Count faster.

115
00:07:56,476 --> 00:08:00,412
It'll be okay. IKeep focusing on Jordy.
He'll be here soon.

116
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:04,913
-Three. Two. Who the hell is Jordy?
-Your son.

117
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:09,144
I don't have a son named Jordy.
We all agreed on Jamie.

118
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:12,449
Jamie was the name
of Susan's first girlfriend...

119
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,649
...so we went back to Jordy.

120
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:19,191
What do you mean, back to Jordy?
We never landed on Jordy.

121
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:24,062
We just passed by it during the whole
Jesse-Cody-Dillon fiasco.

122
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,902
Ow! Leg cramp!

123
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,505
-I got it.
-I got it. I'm doing it.

124
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:32,041
You get to sleep with her.
I get the cramps.

125
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:33,337
No, you don't.

126
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:35,810
That is it.
I want both of you out.

127
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,505
-She started it.
-He did.

128
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:40,982
I'm trying to get
a person out of my body here...

129
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:45,180
...and you're not making it
any easier! Now go!

130
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,091
-Thanks.
-See what you did?

131
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:51,296
-Listen
-Out!

132
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:55,823
Breathe. Breathe.

133
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:05,606
What is that? Something exploded.

134
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:10,170
-That's not the baby, is it?
-Her water broke. Calm down.

135
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,648
Water breaking?
What do you mean? What's that?

136
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,786
Breathe. Breathe.

137
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:22,759
I'm okay. I'm okay.
That's disgusting. I'm okay.

138
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:26,928
-This is so your fault.
-How is this my fault?

139
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:30,500
Carol never threw me out
of a room before you.

140
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:34,297
There's a lot of things
Carol never did before me.

141
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:39,275
-Are you trying to be clever?
-You're so threatened by me.

142
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:43,574
Hey. Okay, all right.
That's it. Get in here.

143
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:47,184
My God, you guys.
I don't believe you.

144
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:50,479
There are children
coming into the world here...

145
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:54,248
...and your fighting isn't
the first thing they should hear.

146
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:56,961
So stop all the yelling!
Just stop it!

147
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:04,495
Don't make me do this again!
I don't like my voice like this!

148
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,905
Who wants to hear something ironic?

149
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:18,074
Are they here yet?

150
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:20,649
Don't worry,
we're gonna find them.

151
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:24,254
And until we do,
we are all here for you. Okay?

152
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:29,226
You were telling me
about Paris. It sounds wonderful.

153
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:34,024
There was this great little
pastry shop right by my hotel

154
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:36,394
There you go, dear.

155
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:41,065
-You find them?
-Not in the gift shop or cafeteria....

156
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:43,468
Where are Phoebe and Joey?

157
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:46,806
There's something sinister
going on here.

158
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:50,779
If you find anyone,
or parts of anyone...

159
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:55,147
...scream. And scream again.

160
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:00,719
-Help!
-Come on!

161
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:04,521
-I'm having a baby in there!
-Hello!

162
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,130
Okay, everyone stand back.

163
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:11,627
Ow.

164
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:15,968
All right, good thing
we're in a hospital.

165
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:18,801
Come on, Lydia, you can do it.

166
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,912
Push him out, push him out.
Harder, harder.

167
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:24,611
Push him out, push him out.
Way out.

168
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:27,684
Let's get that ball and really move.

169
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,878
Let's get

170
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:35,686
I was just Yeah, okay.
Push, push, push.

171
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:40,425
What are you gonna do,
suck the door open?

172
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:45,564
Help! Help!

173
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:50,566
And they found their bodies
The very next day

174
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:54,769
And they found their bodies
The very next

175
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:01,745
Mom, everything's going fine.

176
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:03,477
Ross is great.

177
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:06,414
He's in a whole other place.

178
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:08,484
No, he's gone.

179
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:12,291
No, you don't have to fly back.
Really.

180
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:17,093
What do you mean "This might be your
only chance"? I'm only 26.

181
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:20,794
I'm not even thinking
about babies yet.

182
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:36,282
-Where have you been?
-I just had a baby.

183
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:39,290
Mazel tov.

184
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:45,830
It could be one hour or three.

185
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:48,260
But relax.
She's doing great.

186
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:53,063
So tell me, are you currently
involved with anyone?

187
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:57,431
Not at the moment, I'm not. Are you?

188
00:12:57,643 --> 00:13:00,976
No, it's hard enough to get women
to go out with me.

189
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,046
Right. Yeah, I've heard that
about cute doctors.

190
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:10,616
No, really. I suppose it's because
I spend so much time, you know...

191
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:12,551
...where I do.

192
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:19,021
I try not to let work
affect my personal life.

193
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:23,793
But it's hard when, when you do
what I do. It's, like....

194
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:26,537
Well, for instance,
what do you do?

195
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:28,172
I'm a waitress.

196
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:34,142
Aren't there times when you come home
at night and you're, like:

197
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:38,248
"If I see one more cup of coffee...."

198
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:44,817
Gotcha.

199
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:49,354
-I'm gonna check up on your friend.
-That's fine.

200
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:01,538
-How'd you know I was here?
-Your mom called me.

201
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,941
So is this her?

202
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:06,407
No, this is a loaner.

203
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:10,615
Ours is at the shop.

204
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,614
God, I hope she has my brains.

205
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,021
I'm sorry you had to do this
by yourself.

206
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:23,494
I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor,
a nurse and a helper guy.

207
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:30,294
-So did you see who won the game?
-The Knicks by 10. They suck.

208
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,305
They're not so bad.

209
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:59,093
Come on. Come on.

210
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:03,928
-You're doing it too hard.
-You have to do it hard or else

211
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,898
Damn it. Damn it.

212
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:08,537
Damn it, damn it.
This is all your fault.

213
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,232
This should be
the greatest day of my life.

214
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:14,034
My son is being born,
and I should be in there.

215
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,544
Instead, I'm stuck
in a closet with you.

216
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:20,012
I have been waiting for this
as much as you.

217
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:23,382
No one's been waiting
for this as much as I have.

218
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,886
You know what's funny?

219
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:28,684
You go home with the baby.
Where does that leave me?

220
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:30,327
You're his father.

221
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:34,431
Who am l? There's Father's Day.
There's Mother's Day.

222
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,931
There's no Lesbian Lover Day.

223
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:39,670
Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.

224
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:45,272
This is so great.

225
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,508
Do you wanna explain that?

226
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:53,810
I mean, when I was growing up,
my dad left...

227
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:57,850
...and my mother died
and my stepfather went to jail.

228
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:01,718
I barely had enough pieces
to make one whole parent.

229
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:05,526
And here's this baby who has
three whole parents...

230
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:09,633
...who fight over
who gets to love it the most...

231
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:11,961
...and it's not even born yet.

232
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:16,100
It's just the luckiest baby
in the whole world.

233
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:20,108
I'm sorry. You were fighting.

234
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,505
Where are they?

235
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:26,582
-They'll be here.
-They wouldn't miss this.

236
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:32,155
Relax. You're only at 9 centimeters,
and the baby's at zero station.

237
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:37,094
You are really frightening me.

238
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:42,725
Somebody wanna help me?
Trying to rip out my heart.

239
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:46,429
That's great.
Anybody seen a nipple?

240
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:50,868
Ten centimeters.
Here we go.

241
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:54,341
-Time to start pushing.
-But they're not here yet.

242
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:59,006
-I can't tell the baby to wait.
-Oh, God.

243
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:06,391
-Okay, got the vent open.
-Hi, I'm Ben.

244
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:10,557
I'm hospital worker Ben.

245
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,891
It's Ben to the rescue.

246
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:18,635
Ben, you ready? Give me your foot.

247
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:22,773
On three, Ben.
One, two, three.

248
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:26,402
Come on, Ben.
That's it, Ben.

249
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:28,846
What do you see?

250
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:32,942
I see what appears to be
a dark vent.

251
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:34,345
Wait.

252
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,646
Yes, it is, in fact, a dark vent.

253
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:43,458
Pheebs, it's open.
It's open.

254
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:49,630
Wait. You forgot your legs.

255
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:53,599
-Push. Push.
-We're here. We're here.

256
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,567
Where have you been?

257
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:58,601
Long story.

258
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:04,272
I need you to keep pushing.
I need Excuse me, can I have this?

259
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:09,346
There's too many people here.
There's about to be one more.

260
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:14,558
So if you're not an ex-husband or
lesbian life partner, out you go.

261
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:18,291
-Bye-bye.
-Good luck, you guys.

262
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:22,297
Do you have to be
Carol's lesbian life partner?

263
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:23,796
Out.

264
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:27,330
Here he comes.

265
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:30,371
Let me see. I've gotta see.

266
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:36,007
A head.

267
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:39,082
It's huge.
How are you doing this?

268
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:42,376
You're not helping.

269
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:44,419
You're doing great.

270
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:46,556
-Hello?
-Oh, sorry.

271
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,783
What do you see?
What do you see?

272
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:54,455
We got a head. We got arms.
Oh, look at the little fingers.

273
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,630
A chest and a stomach...

274
00:18:56,869 --> 00:19:00,430
...and it's a boy, definitely a boy.

275
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,800
Legs, knees and feet.

276
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,241
He's here.

277
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:13,876
He's a person.

278
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:16,447
-Look.
-What does he look like?

279
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:20,455
IKind of like my Uncle Ed,
covered in Jell-O.

280
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,725
Really?

281
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:25,492
You guys, he's beautiful.

282
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:27,391
Thanks, Pheebs.

283
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:38,167
No shouting, but we still need
a name for this little guy.

284
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:43,172
-How about Ben?
-I like Ben.

285
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:45,077
Ben.

286
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:52,622
Ben's good. How come you never
mentioned Ben before?

287
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,552
We just cooked it up.

288
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:58,687
That's what we were off doing.

289
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,291
-Can we come in?
-Yeah, come on.

290
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:13,304
I know. I know.

291
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:16,777
Everybody, there's someone
I'd like you to meet.

292
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,310
-This is Ben.
-Hi, Ben.

293
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,417
Ben, this is everybody.

294
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,982
Susan, he looks just like you.

295
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,988
Thanks.

296
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:33,929
I can't believe one of us
actually has one of these.

297
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,600
I know.
I still am one of these.

298
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:41,834
Can l?

299
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,768
Okay, the head. You gotta....

300
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:57,951
I'm your Aunt Monica.
Yes, I am.

301
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,215
I'm your Aunt Monica.

302
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:07,695
I will always have gum.

303
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,597
Ben...

304
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:17,972
... I want you to know that
there may be some times when...

305
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:21,940
... I may not be around like this.

306
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,378
But I'll still always come back...

307
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:30,284
...Iike this.

308
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:35,120
And sometimes,
I may be away longer...

309
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,757
...Iike this.

310
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:43,227
But I'll still always come back...

311
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,499
...Iike this.

312
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:54,044
And sometimes, I'll want you to steal
third and I'll go like this:

313
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:04,319
He is so amazing.

314
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:07,183
Yeah, I know. Look at him.

315
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:16,000
Nothing.
I don't think that's his name.

316
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:20,130
Look, he's closing his eyes.

317
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,467
Look, he's opening his eyes.

318
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,835
He doesn't do much, does he?

319
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:30,777
Nope, this is pretty much it.

320
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:41,048
You guys wanna get some coffee?

321
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:44,319
I'll see you guys later.

322
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:19,226
He's closing his eyes again.
