00:00:02,092 --> 00:00:03,764
-Tell him!
-Please tell him!

2
00:00:03,972 --> 00:00:04,768
Shut up!

3
00:00:04,972 --> 00:00:06,121
Tell me what?

4
00:00:06,332 --> 00:00:07,685
You won't even look at him.

5
00:00:07,892 --> 00:00:11,646
Come on. I could use another
reason why women won't Look at me.

6
00:00:11,892 --> 00:00:13,041
AII right.

7
00:00:13,292 --> 00:00:16,125
Last night, I had a dream. . .

8
00:00:16,372 --> 00:00:17,646
. . .that you and I. . .

9
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:18,688
. . .were. . . .

10
00:00:18,892 --> 00:00:20,689
Doing it on this table.

11
00:00:22,812 --> 00:00:25,406
Excellent dream score.

12
00:00:28,972 --> 00:00:30,849
Why would you dream that?

13
00:00:32,292 --> 00:00:33,645
More importantly. . .

14
00:00:33,852 --> 00:00:35,080
. . .was I any good?

15
00:00:36,452 --> 00:00:39,012
Well, you were pretty damn good.

16
00:00:39,292 --> 00:00:42,523
Interesting. In my dreams,
I'm surprisingly inadequate.

17
00:00:44,612 --> 00:00:47,604
Last night, you seemed to know
your way around the table.

18
00:00:51,372 --> 00:00:53,602
I love it when we share.

19
00:00:57,452 --> 00:00:58,248
You okay?

20
00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:01,609
I can't believe you two
had sex in her dream!

21
00:01:02,372 --> 00:01:04,249
I'm sorry.
It was a one-time thing.

22
00:01:04,452 --> 00:01:07,649
I was very drunk, and it was
someone else's subconscious.

23

25
00:01:55,812 --> 00:01:57,006
Hello, Rachel.

26
00:01:57,612 --> 00:01:59,011
Get off!

27
00:02:01,572 --> 00:02:04,609
Oh, give me! Can you see me
operating a drill press?

28
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:08,003
I don't know.
What are you wearing?

29
00:02:11,652 --> 00:02:14,086
Why would you want to
operate a drill press?

30
00:02:14,292 --> 00:02:15,611
For some short-term work.

31
00:02:15,812 --> 00:02:18,042
Till I get back some
of my massage clients.

32
00:02:18,292 --> 00:02:19,805
Pirates again?

33
00:02:20,372 --> 00:02:22,761
No. Nothing like that.

34
00:02:22,972 --> 00:02:25,042
I'm just such a dummy.

35
00:02:25,292 --> 00:02:27,852
I taught a ''Massage Yourself
at Home'' workshop.

36
00:02:28,092 --> 00:02:29,605
And they are.

37
00:02:31,012 --> 00:02:33,048
Hey, Chan, she could work for you.

38
00:02:33,892 --> 00:02:36,247
Thanks, Joey. That's a good idea.

39
00:02:36,572 --> 00:02:38,051
I could! I could do it!

40
00:02:38,252 --> 00:02:39,321
What is it?

41
00:02:39,532 --> 00:02:41,204
My secretary's gonna be out.

42
00:02:41,412 --> 00:02:43,368
She's having one of her
boobs reduced.

43
00:02:44,812 --> 00:02:47,280
It's a whole big boob story.

44
00:02:47,492 --> 00:02:48,720
I could be a secretary.

45
00:02:49,292 --> 00:02:51,806
I don't know if it's
your kind of thing. . .

46
00:02:52,012 --> 00:02:54,401
. . .because it involves
a lot of being normal. . .

47
00:02:55,292 --> 00:02:56,771
. . .for a large portion of the day.

48
00:02:57,172 --> 00:02:58,810
I could do that.

49
00:03:00,292 --> 00:03:02,362
-What're you playing with?
-My new beeper.

50
00:03:02,572 --> 00:03:04,927
Why does a paleontologist
need a beeper?

51
00:03:05,132 --> 00:03:07,043
Is it for dinosaur emergencies?

52
00:03:07,292 --> 00:03:08,964
Help! They're still extinct!

53
00:03:10,492 --> 00:03:13,848
It's for when Carol goes into labor.
She can get me wherever I am.

54
00:03:14,092 --> 00:03:17,528
AII she has to do is dial 55-JIMBO.

55
00:03:18,372 --> 00:03:20,806
A cool number and
a possible name for the kid.

56
00:03:21,852 --> 00:03:22,807
See you later.

57
00:03:23,052 --> 00:03:24,405
Off to see young Ethan?

58
00:03:24,892 --> 00:03:26,211
Thank you.

59
00:03:27,092 --> 00:03:29,606
How young is young Ethan?
Young?

60
00:03:30,492 --> 00:03:32,642
He's our age.

61
00:03:32,892 --> 00:03:34,405
When we were. . . .

62
00:03:38,012 --> 00:03:39,604
He's a senior in college.

63
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:40,967
College?

64
00:03:42,612 --> 00:03:45,206
This man-child has no problem
with how old you are?

65
00:03:45,652 --> 00:03:46,641
No, of course not.

66
00:03:46,892 --> 00:03:48,644
It's not even an issue. . .

67
00:03:48,892 --> 00:03:50,484
. . .because I told him I was 22.

68
00:03:50,692 --> 00:03:51,920
-You what?
-What?

69
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:53,565
Oh, I can't pass for 22?

70
00:03:53,772 --> 00:03:55,603
Well, maybe 25, 26.

71
00:03:55,852 --> 00:03:56,887
I am 26.

72
00:03:57,292 --> 00:03:58,361
There you go.

73
00:04:10,692 --> 00:04:12,011
Can you hear that?

74
00:04:16,092 --> 00:04:18,083
That'll stop
when you pick up the phone.

75
00:04:20,812 --> 00:04:21,801
Oh, I'm on!

76
00:04:24,692 --> 00:04:26,808
Mr. Bing's office.

77
00:04:28,812 --> 00:04:30,848
I'm sorry he's
in a meeting right now.

78
00:04:31,092 --> 00:04:32,650
I'm not in a meeting.

79
00:04:32,892 --> 00:04:35,452
Will he know what
this is in reference to?

80
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,205
And he has your number?

81
00:04:37,412 --> 00:04:40,006
I'II see that he gets
the message. Bye-bye!

82
00:04:43,452 --> 00:04:44,248
Ross says hi.

83
00:04:45,892 --> 00:04:48,406
This is so fun!
What do we do now?

84
00:04:48,612 --> 00:04:51,365
Well, now I actually
have to get to work.

85
00:04:51,612 --> 00:04:53,204
''Most likely. ''

86
00:04:57,052 --> 00:04:59,122
Okay, I'm gonna be out there.

87
00:04:59,412 --> 00:05:01,209
AII right. Bye-bye.

88
00:05:01,452 --> 00:05:02,805
Bye-bye.

89
00:05:08,252 --> 00:05:09,048
Yes?

90
00:05:09,292 --> 00:05:11,010
What you doing?

91
00:05:14,092 --> 00:05:17,368
Okay, windows are clean.
Candles are lit.

92
00:05:17,572 --> 00:05:19,767
Belt's too tight.
Gotta change the belt.

93
00:05:19,972 --> 00:05:22,850
Did I turn the fish?
Nope, because I made lasagna.

94
00:05:24,492 --> 00:05:25,527
Am I out of control?

95
00:05:26,212 --> 00:05:27,645
Just a touch.

96
00:05:28,212 --> 00:05:31,807
Mon, I don't understand.
You've been dating this guy since. . .

97
00:05:32,012 --> 00:05:33,047
. . .his midterms.

98
00:05:34,452 --> 00:05:36,602
Why, all of the sudden,
are you so. . .?

99
00:05:40,812 --> 00:05:41,608
What?

100
00:05:42,492 --> 00:05:45,211
Could tonight be the night?

101
00:05:46,772 --> 00:05:49,650
I don't know. He's a great guy. . .

102
00:05:49,852 --> 00:05:53,003
. . .and I Love being with him.
But, you know. . .

103
00:05:53,372 --> 00:05:56,409
. . .things happen when they happen.
You don't plan these things.

104
00:05:58,452 --> 00:05:59,885
So did you shave your legs?

105
00:06:04,972 --> 00:06:07,850
Would you let it go, Ross?
It was just a dream.

106
00:06:08,052 --> 00:06:09,451
It doesn't mean--

107
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,642
This is it! It's baby time.
Baby time!

108
00:06:13,892 --> 00:06:16,326
AII right, relax, just relax.
Be cool.

109
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:20,209
Yeah, hi. I was just beeped.

110
00:06:21,892 --> 00:06:23,848
No, Andre is not here.

111
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,162
Third time today.

112
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:28,210
Yes, I am sure.

113
00:06:29,292 --> 00:06:31,328
I do not perform
those kind of services.

114
00:06:32,772 --> 00:06:34,205
Services?

115
00:06:34,412 --> 00:06:35,606
Oh, services.

116
00:06:36,252 --> 00:06:39,244
Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO.

117
00:06:43,052 --> 00:06:44,451
That's right.

118
00:06:44,652 --> 00:06:47,610
That's right.
JUMBO with a ''U,'' sir.

119
00:06:47,852 --> 00:06:49,251
No, you don't want me.

120
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:52,609
Judging by his number,
I'd be a huge disappointment.

121
00:06:53,812 --> 00:06:55,803
Alrighty, bye-bye.

122
00:06:59,412 --> 00:07:01,209
How was the first day?

123
00:07:01,412 --> 00:07:04,643
Excellent!
Everyone was so, so nice!

124
00:07:04,852 --> 00:07:07,286
It pays to know the man
who wears my shoes.

125
00:07:08,492 --> 00:07:09,288
Me.

126
00:07:11,292 --> 00:07:13,681
-I didn't tell anyone I knew you.
-Why not?

127
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:15,610
Well, because, you know.

128
00:07:16,572 --> 00:07:18,005
They don't Like you.

129
00:07:21,612 --> 00:07:22,408
What?

130
00:07:22,652 --> 00:07:23,641
I thought you knew.

131
00:07:26,492 --> 00:07:27,447
Who doesn't Like me?

132
00:07:27,892 --> 00:07:29,405
Everyone.

133
00:07:29,692 --> 00:07:31,250
Except for. . . .

134
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,005
No. Everyone.

135
00:07:35,692 --> 00:07:37,045
What are you talking about?

136
00:07:37,252 --> 00:07:38,605
Don't feel bad.

137
00:07:38,812 --> 00:07:40,962
You know, they used to
Like you a Lot.

138
00:07:41,172 --> 00:07:43,447
But you got promoted,
and now you're. . .

139
00:07:43,652 --> 00:07:45,802
. . .Mr. Boss Man.
You know, Mr. Big.

140
00:07:46,012 --> 00:07:47,331
Mr. Bing. Boss Man Bing.

141
00:07:50,092 --> 00:07:51,161
I can't believe it.

142
00:07:51,492 --> 00:07:53,323
Yeah. They even do you.

143
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:55,688
They ''do'' me?

144
00:07:57,012 --> 00:07:58,525
You know, Like, okay.

145
00:07:59,372 --> 00:08:01,602
''Could that report be any Later?''

146
00:08:07,092 --> 00:08:08,127
I don't sound Like that.

147
00:08:08,972 --> 00:08:09,768
Yeah, you do.

148
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:14,211
''The hills are alive
with the sound. . .

149

I don't sound Like that.
That is so not true.

153
00:08:31,972 --> 00:08:33,849
That is so not--
That is so not--

154
00:08:34,092 --> 00:08:36,083
That--
Oh, shut up!

155
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:42,212
-Did not!
-I'm telling you, up until I was 9. . .

156
00:08:42,452 --> 00:08:45,091
. . .I thought gunpoint was
a place where crimes happened.

157
00:08:45,812 --> 00:08:46,642
How's that possible?

158
00:08:46,892 --> 00:08:48,644
It's always on the news.

159
00:08:48,892 --> 00:08:51,611
''A man is being held up at Gunpoint. ''

161

And I kept thinking,
why do people continue to go there?

162
00:09:02,972 --> 00:09:03,927
I should go.

163
00:09:13,492 --> 00:09:14,561
-Unless--
-What?

164
00:09:16,612 --> 00:09:18,648
Unless you wanna stay over.

165
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,564
I mean, I'm going to. So. . . .

166
00:09:23,172 --> 00:09:25,208
Yeah, I'd really Like that.

167
00:09:32,212 --> 00:09:36,251
Before we get into any
staying-over stuff. . .

168
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:38,403
. . .there's something you should know.

169
00:09:38,932 --> 00:09:42,049
Is this, Like,
''I have an early class tomorrow'' . . .

170
00:09:42,292 --> 00:09:44,806
. . .or ''I'm secretly married
to a goat''?

171
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:48,762
Well, it's somewhere in between.

172
00:09:48,972 --> 00:09:53,011
You see, in a strictly technical
sense, of course, I'm not. . . .

173
00:09:53,212 --> 00:09:55,965
Well, I mean, I haven't ever. . . .

174
00:09:56,172 --> 00:09:57,400
Ethan?

175
00:09:58,212 --> 00:09:59,281
Are you a virgin?

176
00:09:59,692 --> 00:10:03,651
Well, if that's what you kids are
calling it these days, then. . .

177
00:10:03,892 --> 00:10:04,802
. . .yes, I am.

178
00:10:07,692 --> 00:10:10,968
I am. I've kind of been
waiting for the right person.

179
00:10:12,772 --> 00:10:14,000
Really?

180
00:10:16,292 --> 00:10:18,522
You do know I was talking
about you, right?

181
00:10:27,092 --> 00:10:28,411
Wow!

182
00:10:29,492 --> 00:10:30,971
You keep saying that.

183
00:10:31,572 --> 00:10:34,848
You know, you read about it.
You see it in the movies.

184
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:38,607
Even when you practice it at home,
man, oh, man. . .

185
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,406
. . .it is nothing Like that.

186
00:10:44,052 --> 00:10:45,690
Listen, listen.

187
00:10:47,692 --> 00:10:51,765
You told me something
that was really difficult for you.

188
00:10:51,972 --> 00:10:55,931
And I figure if you can
be honest, then I can too.

189
00:10:56,652 --> 00:10:58,210
Don't tell me I did it wrong.

190
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,408
Nothing wrong about that.

191
00:11:06,892 --> 00:11:08,211
Here goes.

192
00:11:09,612 --> 00:11:11,443
I'm not 22.

193
00:11:12,012 --> 00:11:14,207
I'm 25. . .

194
00:11:15,452 --> 00:11:16,771
. . .and 1 3 months.

195
00:11:19,692 --> 00:11:22,001
But I figure that shouldn’t
change anything.

196
00:11:22,212 --> 00:11:24,442
What does it matter how old we are?

197
00:11:28,012 --> 00:11:29,206
Listen. . .

198
00:11:29,892 --> 00:11:31,928
. . .as long as we're
telling stuff. . .

199
00:11:33,892 --> 00:11:36,008
. . .I have another one for you.

200
00:11:36,692 --> 00:11:38,922
I'm a little younger than I said.

201
00:11:41,012 --> 00:11:42,240
You're not a senior?

202
00:11:42,492 --> 00:11:44,403
Oh, I'm a senior. . .

203
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:49,327
. . .in high school.

204
00:12:01,252 --> 00:12:03,049
What we did was wrong.

205
00:12:03,252 --> 00:12:07,404
I just had sex with someone who
wasn't alive during the bicentennial!

206
00:12:10,692 --> 00:12:12,603
I just had sex.

207
00:12:14,892 --> 00:12:18,043
Ethan, focus.
How could you not tell me?

208
00:12:18,252 --> 00:12:19,571
You never told me your age.

209
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:20,807
That's different!

210
00:12:21,012 --> 00:12:24,209
My lie didn't make one of us
a felon in 48 states!

211
00:12:25,652 --> 00:12:28,610
-What were you thinking?
-I was too busy falling--

212
00:12:28,852 --> 00:12:29,682
Don't say it!

213
00:12:29,892 --> 00:12:30,847
In Love with you.

214
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:33,601
Really?

215
00:12:33,812 --> 00:12:34,801
Sorry.

216
00:12:36,612 --> 00:12:37,840
Well, fall out of it.

217
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:40,367
You shouldn’t be here.
It's a school night!

218
00:12:43,292 --> 00:12:45,044
Oh, God!

219
00:12:45,292 --> 00:12:47,442
I'm Like those women
that you see. . .

220
00:12:47,692 --> 00:12:50,001
. . .with shiny guys named Chad.

221
00:12:53,052 --> 00:12:54,804
I'm Joan Collins.

222
00:12:58,012 --> 00:12:58,808
Who?

223
00:13:07,212 --> 00:13:10,409
Andre should be there
in about 45 minutes.

224
00:13:11,652 --> 00:13:13,608
Alrighty. Bye-bye.

225
00:13:15,812 --> 00:13:17,643
It's just easier that way.

226
00:13:19,452 --> 00:13:21,647
You told me about the last dream.

227
00:13:21,892 --> 00:13:23,450
No. Forget it.

228
00:13:23,652 --> 00:13:27,406
Why not? Was I doing
something particularly saucy?

229
00:13:29,492 --> 00:13:31,005
AII right. Fine.

230
00:13:32,692 --> 00:13:34,603
You were not the only one there.

231
00:13:36,172 --> 00:13:37,082
Joey was too.

232
00:13:39,692 --> 00:13:40,488
AII right.

233
00:13:42,292 --> 00:13:43,771
Was there. . .

234
00:13:47,332 --> 00:13:49,527
. . .anybody else there?

235
00:13:49,892 --> 00:13:50,688
No.

236
00:13:51,132 --> 00:13:53,043
You sure? Nobody. . .

237
00:13:53,252 --> 00:13:55,812
. . .handing out mints or anything?

238
00:13:57,692 --> 00:13:59,250
No, just the three of us.

239
00:14:02,172 --> 00:14:03,844
So was it you and Chandler. . .

240
00:14:04,092 --> 00:14:06,367
. . .then you and me
or you, me and Chandler?

241
00:14:08,692 --> 00:14:10,728
-You know what?
-What?

242
00:14:11,492 --> 00:14:13,244
There were times. . .

243
00:14:13,492 --> 00:14:15,403
. . .when it wasn't even me.

244
00:14:24,892 --> 00:14:28,202
That is so sweet, you guys!

245
00:14:33,692 --> 00:14:35,091
Mon, Ethan called again.

246
00:14:42,452 --> 00:14:43,248
What?

247
00:14:43,452 --> 00:14:44,680
Ethan called again.

248
00:14:46,092 --> 00:14:47,445
You're not seeing him anymore?

249
00:14:47,652 --> 00:14:49,005
No.

250
00:14:49,252 --> 00:14:51,447
Sometimes, just things don't work out.

251
00:14:51,772 --> 00:14:55,731
This has nothing to do with him
needing a note to get out of gym?

252
00:14:59,692 --> 00:15:02,604
I didn't say any--
I did not say anything. I swear.

253
00:15:02,852 --> 00:15:04,001
He stopped by.

254
00:15:04,212 --> 00:15:05,565
Next time you talk to him. . .

255
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:09,208
. . .could you ask him which one
the strongest Power Ranger is?

256
00:15:11,692 --> 00:15:15,287
Oh, my life is just so amusing.
Can we drop it now?

257
00:15:15,492 --> 00:15:16,686
Sorry.

258
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:18,691
''It's morphin time! ''

259
00:15:18,892 --> 00:15:20,405
-Stegosaurus!
-Tyrannosaurus!

260
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:27,211
I gotta go.

261
00:15:27,492 --> 00:15:28,811
Head rush.

262
00:15:30,892 --> 00:15:33,452
One more, and then I have to go.

263
00:15:33,692 --> 00:15:34,681
Cool.

264
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:39,168
Where you going?

265
00:15:40,492 --> 00:15:42,528
A birthday party
with some work people.

266
00:15:42,732 --> 00:15:44,211
Work people?

267
00:15:45,292 --> 00:15:46,202
Nobody told me.

268
00:15:46,452 --> 00:15:48,647
No, I know.
That's part of the whole. . .

269
00:15:48,892 --> 00:15:51,167
. . .them-not-liking-you
extravaganza.

270
00:15:53,292 --> 00:15:56,204
I don't get it. A month ago,
these people were my friends.

271
00:15:56,412 --> 00:15:59,324
Just because I'm in charge,
I'm not a different person.

272
00:15:59,652 --> 00:16:04,282
Then come, hang out. Let them see
what a great guy you still are.

273
00:16:04,492 --> 00:16:06,528
-You think I should?
-I really do.

274
00:16:08,572 --> 00:16:10,164
But could we not go together?

275
00:16:11,772 --> 00:16:14,411
I don't wanna be the geek
who invited the boss.

276
00:16:18,292 --> 00:16:19,611
Last night was great.

277
00:16:19,852 --> 00:16:23,401
You know, the karaoke thing?
Tracy and I doing ''Ebony and Ivory. ''

278
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:26,286
You were great!
But they still made fun of you.

279
00:16:26,932 --> 00:16:27,728
What?

280
00:16:27,932 --> 00:16:29,650
Now you're Mr. Caring Boss.

281
00:16:29,892 --> 00:16:31,371
Mr. I'm-one-of-you Boss.

282
00:16:31,572 --> 00:16:34,166
Mr. I-wanna-be-your-buddy.
Boss Man Bing!

283
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:37,010
Then I don't get it.

284
00:16:37,892 --> 00:16:41,487
Well, you know what, Chandler?
I think you just gotta face it.

285
00:16:41,692 --> 00:16:44,047
You're, Like, the guy
in the big office.

286
00:16:44,252 --> 00:16:47,005
You're the one that hires them
and fires them.

287
00:16:47,252 --> 00:16:48,685
They say you're a great boss.

288
00:16:49,012 --> 00:16:49,808
They do?

289
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:52,441
But they're not
your friends anymore.

290
00:16:53,572 --> 00:16:55,369
-I just want--
-But you can't.

291
00:16:56,412 --> 00:16:57,527
But I just want--

292
00:17:08,092 --> 00:17:08,888
Are you gonna--

293
00:17:09,092 --> 00:17:12,607
Carol and I have a new system.
If she punches in 9-1 -1 . . .

294
00:17:12,812 --> 00:17:16,202
. . .it means she's having a baby.
Otherwise, I just ignore it.

295
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:17,567
What about Andre?

296
00:17:17,772 --> 00:17:20,764
He got a call from what I think
was our cousin, Nathan.

297
00:17:20,972 --> 00:17:23,611
Frankly, it was a Little more
than I needed to know.

298
00:17:32,012 --> 00:17:33,331
That was gonna be my opener.

299
00:17:34,772 --> 00:17:38,447
Did you guys check out those
new hand dryers in the bathroom?

300
00:17:38,652 --> 00:17:40,802
-I thought that was just a rumor.
-True story.

301
00:17:45,292 --> 00:17:47,442
Look, I gotta tell you something.

302
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:51,321
I'm not 1 7. I said that so you'd
think I was cute and vulnerable.

303
00:17:51,532 --> 00:17:52,647
I'm actually 30.

304
00:17:52,892 --> 00:17:55,804
I have a wife. I have a job.
I'm your congressman.

305
00:17:57,092 --> 00:17:59,652
This is ridiculous.
We are great together!

306
00:17:59,892 --> 00:18:03,646
We can talk. We make each other
laugh. And the sex. Oh, man!

307
00:18:03,852 --> 00:18:06,571
I have no frame of reference,
but I thought that was great!

308
00:18:07,772 --> 00:18:09,524
-It was.
-What's the problem?

309
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:14,003
Ethan, it's. . . .

310
00:18:16,052 --> 00:18:16,928
It's icky.

311
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:18,768
''Icky''?

312
00:18:19,612 --> 00:18:23,082
You're actually gonna throw this away
because it's icky?

313
00:18:24,412 --> 00:18:26,368
This isn't easy for me either.

314
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:28,051
I wish things were different.

315
00:18:28,292 --> 00:18:30,760
If you were older
or I was younger. . .

316
00:18:30,972 --> 00:18:33,486
. . .or we lived in biblical times. . .

317
00:18:34,452 --> 00:18:35,248
. . .I could really--

318
00:18:35,452 --> 00:18:36,965
No, don't say it.

319
00:18:37,172 --> 00:18:38,207
Love you.

320
00:18:42,812 --> 00:18:44,803
-Are your hands still wet?
-They're moist.

321
00:18:45,012 --> 00:18:46,604
Let's dry them again.

322
00:18:52,492 --> 00:18:55,802
Or, Like, ''Could these margaritas
be any stronger?''

323
00:18:57,932 --> 00:18:59,047
