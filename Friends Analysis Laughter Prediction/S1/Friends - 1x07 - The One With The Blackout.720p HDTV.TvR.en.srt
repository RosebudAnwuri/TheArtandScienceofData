1
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:07,526
Hey, gorgeous! How's it going?

2
00:00:07,776 --> 00:00:10,654
Dehydrated Japanese noodles
under fluorescent lights.

3
00:00:10,896 --> 00:00:13,046
Does it get better than this?

4
00:00:13,736 --> 00:00:16,045
Question: You're not dating, are you?

5
00:00:16,296 --> 00:00:18,764
I met somebody who would be
perfect for you.

6
00:00:19,216 --> 00:00:21,252
You see, perfect might be a problem.

7
00:00:21,496 --> 00:00:24,886
Had you said co-dependent
or self-destructive. . . .

8
00:00:25,616 --> 00:00:27,732
-You want a date Saturday?
-Yes, please.

9
00:00:29,616 --> 00:00:30,731
He is cute.

10
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:33,046
-He's funny. He's--
-He's a he?

11
00:00:33,256 --> 00:00:34,609
Well, yeah.

12
00:00:34,896 --> 00:00:35,772
Oh, God!

13
00:00:36,056 --> 00:00:37,330
I just--

14
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:39,644
You're nice-- Oh, God.

15
00:00:39,976 --> 00:00:43,525
Good, Shelly. I'm gonna go
flush myself down the toilet now.

16
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:44,845
Okay. Bye-bye.

17
00:00:47,056 --> 00:00:49,092
The One Where Nana Dies Twice

19
00:01:31,576 --> 00:01:35,285
It's hard to enjoy Ramen noodles
after that. Is that ridiculous?

20
00:01:35,536 --> 00:01:38,004
Can you believe she actually
thought that?

21
00:01:43,176 --> 00:01:45,644
When I first met you,
I thought maybe. . .

22
00:01:45,896 --> 00:01:46,931
. . .possibly. . .

23
00:01:47,176 --> 00:01:48,165
. . .you might be.

24
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:50,212
You did?

25
00:01:50,456 --> 00:01:53,653
Then you spent Phoebe's birthday
party talking to my breasts. . .

26
00:01:53,896 --> 00:01:55,614
. . .so then I figured maybe not.

27
00:01:57,256 --> 00:02:02,011
Did any of the rest of you guys
think that when you first met me?

28
00:02:02,216 --> 00:02:03,285
-I did.
-I think so.

29
00:02:05,896 --> 00:02:07,852
-Not me.
-No, no, me neither.

30
00:02:08,696 --> 00:02:11,847
Although back in college,
Susan Saladore did.

31
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,495
You're kidding.

32
00:02:13,936 --> 00:02:15,972
-Did you tell her I wasn't?
-No.

33
00:02:17,176 --> 00:02:19,644
It's because I wanted
to go out with her too.

34
00:02:19,856 --> 00:02:23,132
So I told her, actually,
you were seeing Bernie Spellman. . .

35
00:02:25,576 --> 00:02:26,804
. . .who also liked her.

36
00:02:31,616 --> 00:02:33,413
Well, this is fascinating.

37
00:02:34,176 --> 00:02:35,814
So what is it about me?

38
00:02:36,496 --> 00:02:39,613
I don't know. Because you're smart,
you're funny. . . .

39
00:02:39,856 --> 00:02:42,086
So is Ross.
You ever think that about him?

40
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:43,326
Yeah, right!

41
00:02:43,856 --> 00:02:44,891
What is it?

42
00:02:46,936 --> 00:02:49,928
I don't know. You just--
You have a quality.

43
00:02:50,176 --> 00:02:51,006
Yes, exactly.

44
00:02:51,256 --> 00:02:52,609
Yeah, a quality.

45
00:02:53,296 --> 00:02:57,209
''A quality. '' Good. I was worried
you were gonna be vague about this.

46
00:03:04,456 --> 00:03:06,048
It's Paolo calling from Rome.

47
00:03:06,296 --> 00:03:09,094
Oh, my God! Calling from Rome!

48
00:03:14,056 --> 00:03:16,854
So he's calling from Rome.
I could do that.

49
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,934
Just gotta go to Rome.

50
00:03:21,656 --> 00:03:24,250
Your Dad just beeped in.
Can you make it quick?

51
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,009
I'm talking to Rome.

52
00:03:26,856 --> 00:03:28,369
I'm talking to Rome.

53
00:03:29,456 --> 00:03:30,969
Hey, Dad. What's up?

54
00:03:32,896 --> 00:03:34,011
Oh, God.

55
00:03:35,576 --> 00:03:36,975
Ross, it's Nana.

56
00:03:48,256 --> 00:03:49,894
-How you doing?
-Hey, Dad.

57
00:03:53,656 --> 00:03:54,566
How's she doing?

58
00:03:55,296 --> 00:03:57,605
The doctor says
it's a matter of hours.

59
00:03:58,176 --> 00:04:00,849
-How are you, Mom?
-Me? I'm fine, fine.

60
00:04:01,096 --> 00:04:02,848
I'm glad you're here.

61
00:04:04,496 --> 00:04:05,815
What's with your hair?

62
00:04:06,056 --> 00:04:07,125
What?

63
00:04:07,856 --> 00:04:08,652
What's different?

64
00:04:09,096 --> 00:04:09,972
Nothing.

65
00:04:10,496 --> 00:04:12,452
Oh, maybe that's it.

66
00:04:13,256 --> 00:04:14,735
She's unbelievable.
Her mother's--

67
00:04:14,936 --> 00:04:16,164
Okay, relax.

68
00:04:16,376 --> 00:04:18,810
We are gonna be here a while,
it looks like.

69
00:04:19,016 --> 00:04:21,735
We still have boyfriends
and your career to cover.

70
00:04:22,056 --> 00:04:23,250
Oh, God!

71
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:33,012
The fuzzy little mints
at the bottom of her purse.

72
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:35,892
Yeah, they were gross.

73
00:04:36,696 --> 00:04:38,414
You know what I love?

74
00:04:38,616 --> 00:04:40,368
Her Sweet 'N Lows.

75
00:04:40,576 --> 00:04:43,648
How she was always stealing them
from restaurants.

76
00:04:43,896 --> 00:04:46,808
Not just from restaurants,
from our house.

77
00:04:47,536 --> 00:04:48,332
Mrs. Geller?

78
00:04:54,096 --> 00:04:55,370
She looks so small.

79
00:04:55,816 --> 00:04:56,805
I know.

80
00:04:57,896 --> 00:05:01,206
Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop
and Aunt Phyllis now.

81
00:05:04,856 --> 00:05:06,335
Goodbye, Nana.

82
00:05:13,376 --> 00:05:14,172
Bye, Nana.

83
00:05:20,576 --> 00:05:21,611
Nurse!

84
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:24,330
What is going on?

85
00:05:25,176 --> 00:05:27,815
You know how the nurse said
Nana had passed?

86
00:05:28,016 --> 00:05:29,495
Well, she's not quite.

87
00:05:31,056 --> 00:05:31,852
What?

88
00:05:32,056 --> 00:05:35,685
She's not passed!
She's present! She's back!

89
00:05:36,056 --> 00:05:37,125
What's going on?

90
00:05:37,376 --> 00:05:38,968
She may have died.

91
00:05:39,776 --> 00:05:41,004
''She may have died''?

92
00:05:41,256 --> 00:05:42,484
We're looking into it.

93
00:05:44,376 --> 00:05:45,855
I'll go see.

94
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:50,454
This almost never happens.

95
00:06:07,216 --> 00:06:09,252
Now she's passed.

96
00:06:18,576 --> 00:06:20,692
I just have to know, okay?

97
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:22,450
Is it my hair?

98
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:25,928
Yes, that's exactly what it is.
It's your hair.

99
00:06:26,176 --> 00:06:28,246
Yeah, you have homosexual hair.

100
00:06:34,896 --> 00:06:36,124
So did she. . .?

101
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:37,924
Twice.

102
00:06:40,016 --> 00:06:41,608
Oh, that sucks.

103
00:06:43,816 --> 00:06:44,851
You guys okay?

104
00:06:45,296 --> 00:06:46,854
I don't know. It's weird.

105
00:06:47,096 --> 00:06:50,452
I know she's gone,
but I just don't feel. . . .

106
00:06:50,776 --> 00:06:52,573
Maybe she's not really gone.

107
00:06:52,776 --> 00:06:54,209
No, no, she's gone.

108
00:06:55,096 --> 00:06:56,324
We checked.

109
00:06:56,776 --> 00:06:57,765
A lot.

110
00:06:59,096 --> 00:07:01,849
No, I mean, maybe no one
ever really goes.

111
00:07:02,096 --> 00:07:04,849
Ever since my mom died,
every now and then. . .

112
00:07:05,096 --> 00:07:08,691
. . .I get this feeling that she's,
like, right here, you know?

113
00:07:12,576 --> 00:07:15,010
And Debbie, my best friend
from junior high. . .

114
00:07:15,216 --> 00:07:18,208
. . .got struck by lightning
on a miniature golf course.

115
00:07:19,496 --> 00:07:21,851
I always get this strong
Debbie vibe. . .

116
00:07:22,096 --> 00:07:24,405
. . .whenever I use
a little yellow pencil.

117
00:07:29,376 --> 00:07:30,126
I miss her.

118
00:07:31,296 --> 00:07:32,445
Here, Pheebs.

119
00:07:32,696 --> 00:07:33,651
Want this?

120
00:07:33,896 --> 00:07:35,852
-Oh, thanks.
-Sure.

121
00:07:36,096 --> 00:07:38,212
I just sharpened her this morning.

122
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:43,408
I don't believe any of that.
I think when you're dead. . .

123
00:07:43,656 --> 00:07:46,045
. . .you're dead. You're gone.
You're worm food.

124
00:07:50,176 --> 00:07:51,814
So Chandler looks gay, huh?

125
00:07:55,896 --> 00:07:58,615
I don't know who this is,
but it's not Debbie.

126
00:08:05,976 --> 00:08:07,807
I thought it'd be a closed casket.

127
00:08:08,016 --> 00:08:10,849
Well, that doesn't mean
she can't look nice.

128
00:08:15,576 --> 00:08:18,044
Sweetie, you think
you can get in there?

129
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,094
I don't see why not.

130
00:08:38,496 --> 00:08:39,611
Here's my retainer!

131
00:08:48,776 --> 00:08:50,368
I was just thinking. . .

132
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,493
-. . .when my time comes--
-Dad!

133
00:08:52,736 --> 00:08:53,885
Listen to me!

134
00:08:55,496 --> 00:08:59,125
When my time comes,
I wanna be buried at sea.

135
00:09:01,816 --> 00:09:02,612
You what?

136
00:09:03,496 --> 00:09:06,568
I wanna be buried at sea.
It looks like fun.

137
00:09:08,776 --> 00:09:10,004
Define ''fun. ''

138
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:14,175
Come on. You'll make a day of it.
You'll get a boat, pack a lunch. . . .

139
00:09:14,456 --> 00:09:18,608
And then we throw your body in
the water. Gee, that does sound fun.

140
00:09:18,816 --> 00:09:20,249
Everyone thinks they know me.

141
00:09:20,496 --> 00:09:23,454
Everyone says, ''Jack Geller,
so predictable. ''

142
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:28,247
Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say,
''Buried at sea? Huh. ''

143
00:09:31,496 --> 00:09:33,487
That's probably what they'll say.

144
00:09:34,016 --> 00:09:35,529
I'd like that.

145
00:09:46,976 --> 00:09:47,772
Hey, gorgeous.

146
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:52,055
Look, I'm sorry about yesterday.

147
00:09:52,296 --> 00:09:56,414
Don't worry about it. Apparently,
other people have made the same mistake.

148
00:09:57,616 --> 00:09:59,254
Okay. Phew!

149
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:04,536
So what do you think it is about me?

150
00:10:05,656 --> 00:10:06,805
I don't know what.

151
00:10:07,016 --> 00:10:08,813
You just have. . .

152
00:10:09,016 --> 00:10:10,813
-. . .a quality.
-A quality. Great.

153
00:10:11,296 --> 00:10:14,845
It's a shame, because you and Lowell
would've made a great couple.

154
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:20,575
Lowell? Financial Services Lowell?
That's who you saw me with?

155
00:10:20,856 --> 00:10:21,891
What? He's cute.

156
00:10:22,136 --> 00:10:23,410
Well, yeah.

157
00:10:23,776 --> 00:10:25,732
He's no Brian in Payroll.

158
00:10:28,616 --> 00:10:29,605
Is Brian. . .?

159
00:10:29,856 --> 00:10:33,212
I don't know. The point is,
if you were gonna set me up. . .

160
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:36,169
. . .I'd like to think it'd be
with somebody like him.

161
00:10:36,376 --> 00:10:38,765
I think Brian's
a little out of your league.

162
00:10:43,696 --> 00:10:47,450
Excuse me. You don't think
I could get a Brian?

163
00:10:50,296 --> 00:10:53,447
Because I could get a Brian.
Believe you me.

164
00:10:55,096 --> 00:10:56,495
I'm really not.

165
00:10:57,696 --> 00:10:58,845
This one?

166
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:05,532
I've shown you every dress we have.

167
00:11:05,776 --> 00:11:09,530
Unless you want her to spend eternity
in a lemon-yellow pantsuit. . .

168
00:11:09,776 --> 00:11:11,812
. . .go with the burgundy.

169
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:15,613
Whatever we pick, she would've
told us it's the wrong one.

170
00:11:15,856 --> 00:11:17,926
You're right.
We'll go with the burgundy.

171
00:11:18,176 --> 00:11:20,815
A fine choice. I'm coming out.

172
00:11:21,016 --> 00:11:22,654
Wait! We need shoes.

173
00:11:30,896 --> 00:11:31,806
How about these?

174
00:11:32,496 --> 00:11:34,088
That's really a day shoe.

175
00:11:34,336 --> 00:11:37,294
And where she's going,
everyone else will be dressier?

176
00:11:38,696 --> 00:11:41,085
Could we see something
in a slimmer heel?

177
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:49,614
I have nothing in an evening shoe
in the burgundy.

178
00:11:50,616 --> 00:11:53,210
I can show you something
in a silver that may work.

179
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:56,292
No, it really should be burgundy.

180
00:11:56,656 --> 00:11:58,726
Unless we go with a different dress.

181
00:11:58,976 --> 00:12:00,853
No, no, no. Watch this.

182
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:04,168
Wait, I may have something in the back.

183
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:17,610
Oh, my God.

184
00:12:18,136 --> 00:12:19,694
Is everything all right?

185
00:12:22,496 --> 00:12:24,487
Just Nana's stuff.

186
00:12:42,376 --> 00:12:43,855
How we doing?
You guys ready?

187
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,735
Mom called to remind me
not to wear my hair up.

188
00:12:46,976 --> 00:12:49,206
Did you know my ears were not
my best feature?

189
00:12:49,456 --> 00:12:51,606
Some days it's all I can think about.

190
00:12:52,456 --> 00:12:55,334
Hi! I'm sorry I'm late.
I couldn't find my bearings.

191
00:12:55,896 --> 00:12:57,329
You mean your earrings?

192
00:12:57,896 --> 00:12:59,045
What did I say?

193
00:13:01,296 --> 00:13:04,368
-Are these the shoes?
-Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.

194
00:13:04,696 --> 00:13:07,529
What? We don't have shoes here?

195
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:11,374
Morning. We ready to go?

196
00:13:11,616 --> 00:13:13,493
Don't we look nice all dressed up?

197
00:13:15,216 --> 00:13:17,332
It's stuff like that, isn't it?

198
00:13:28,776 --> 00:13:31,768
-It was a really beautiful service.
-It really was.

199
00:13:33,816 --> 00:13:35,408
Come here, sweetheart.

200
00:13:38,736 --> 00:13:39,532
You know. . .

201
00:13:40,616 --> 00:13:43,414
. . .I think it's time for you
to start using night cream.

202
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:50,292
What?

203
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,886
Nothing. Just your overcoat sounds
remarkably like Brent Musburger.

204
00:13:55,176 --> 00:13:57,531
Check it out. Giants-Cowboys.

205
00:13:58,576 --> 00:14:00,612
You're watching football at a funeral?

206
00:14:00,856 --> 00:14:04,405
No, it's the pregame.
I'm gonna watch it at the reception.

207
00:14:05,296 --> 00:14:07,605
You're a frightening, frightening man.

208
00:14:08,576 --> 00:14:11,648
Oh, no! My new Paolo shoes!

209
00:14:11,896 --> 00:14:13,614
I hope they're not ruined.

210
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:19,690
God, what a great day!

211
00:14:20,456 --> 00:14:22,447
What? Weatherwise.

212
00:14:23,816 --> 00:14:25,169
I know.

213
00:14:25,776 --> 00:14:28,131
The air, the trees.

214
00:14:28,656 --> 00:14:32,615
Even though Nana's gone,
there's something almost life--

215
00:14:34,576 --> 00:14:36,407
Ross, are you okay?

216
00:14:36,656 --> 00:14:37,930
No, I'm fine.

217
00:14:39,136 --> 00:14:40,615
Just. . .

218
00:14:40,856 --> 00:14:43,131
. . .having my worst fear
realized, but. . . .

219
00:14:51,176 --> 00:14:54,088
I'm just checking to see
if the muscle's in spasm.

220
00:14:55,496 --> 00:14:58,135
-What? What is it?
-You missed a belt loop.

221
00:15:00,296 --> 00:15:02,332
Okay, it's in spasm.

222
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:05,088
Here, sweetie. Here.

223
00:15:05,336 --> 00:15:07,372
I took these when I had
my golfing accident.

224
00:15:07,696 --> 00:15:08,572
Thanks, Mom.

225
00:15:16,696 --> 00:15:17,765
Sorry.

226
00:15:18,656 --> 00:15:20,135
Hi, I'm Andrea.

227
00:15:20,576 --> 00:15:22,407
I'm Dorothy's daughter.

228
00:15:22,616 --> 00:15:26,006
Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have
no idea who Dorothy is.

229
00:15:28,896 --> 00:15:30,375
Look who's up!

230
00:15:31,736 --> 00:15:32,566
How do you feel?

231
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,335
I feel great.

232
00:15:36,896 --> 00:15:39,091
I feel great. I feel great.

233
00:15:40,616 --> 00:15:42,493
Wow, those pills really worked.

234
00:15:42,896 --> 00:15:45,649
Yeah. Not the first two,
but the second two. . . .

235
00:15:49,096 --> 00:15:50,688
I love you guys.

236
00:15:52,256 --> 00:15:55,532
You guys are the greatest.
I love my sister.

237
00:15:55,776 --> 00:15:57,892
I love Pheebs.

238
00:15:58,696 --> 00:15:59,970
That's so nice.

239
00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:03,651
I love you, man.

240
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:07,805
And listen,
if you wanna be gay, be gay!

241
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:12,528
It doesn't matter to me.

242
00:16:14,216 --> 00:16:15,205
You were right.

243
00:16:27,096 --> 00:16:29,974
I love you the most.

244
00:16:31,456 --> 00:16:34,812
Well, you know who I love the most?

245
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:37,445
You!

246
00:16:39,496 --> 00:16:41,407
Oh, you don't get it!

247
00:16:47,496 --> 00:16:48,815
What do you got there?

248
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:52,088
Just a hearing disability.

249
00:16:53,176 --> 00:16:54,006
What's the score?

250
00:16:55,536 --> 00:16:58,528
1 7-1 4, Giants.
Three minutes to go in the third.

251
00:16:58,776 --> 00:16:59,765
Beautiful!

252
00:17:08,296 --> 00:17:11,606
Pheebs, could you maybe
hand me a cracker?

253
00:17:14,176 --> 00:17:16,007
Your grandmother would've hated this.

254
00:17:17,016 --> 00:17:19,849
Well, sure. What with it
being her funeral and all.

255
00:17:22,056 --> 00:17:24,251
No, I'd be hearing about. . .

256
00:17:24,496 --> 00:17:27,056
. . .why didn't I get
the honey-glazed ham.

257
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:30,732
Or I didn't spend enough on flowers.
If I spent more, she'd say. . .

258
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:34,213
. . . ''Why waste your money?
I don't need flowers, I'm dead. ''

259
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:36,734
That sounds like Nana.

260
00:17:38,176 --> 00:17:40,610
Do you know what it's like
to grow up. . .

261
00:17:41,176 --> 00:17:45,374
. . .with someone who is critical
of every single thing you say?

262
00:17:47,896 --> 00:17:49,011
I can imagine.

263
00:17:50,176 --> 00:17:52,929
I tell you, it's a wonder
your mother turned out. . .

264
00:17:53,176 --> 00:17:56,168
. . .to be the positive,
life-affirming person she is.

265
00:17:57,896 --> 00:17:59,807
That is a wonder!

266
00:18:02,296 --> 00:18:06,892
So tell me something, Mom.
If you had to do it all over again. . .

267
00:18:07,136 --> 00:18:10,048
. . .I mean, if she was here right now. . .

268
00:18:10,576 --> 00:18:11,725
. . .would you tell her?

269
00:18:12,496 --> 00:18:13,292
Tell her what?

270
00:18:14,696 --> 00:18:19,008
How she drove you crazy,
picking on every little detail.

271
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:21,213
Like your hair, for example.

272
00:18:22,016 --> 00:18:25,486
I'm not sure I know
what you're getting at.

273
00:18:26,896 --> 00:18:30,332
Would things have been better
if you'd just told her the truth?

274
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:39,211
I think some things are
better left unsaid.

275
00:18:39,456 --> 00:18:42,209
I think it's nicer when people
just get along.

276
00:18:46,216 --> 00:18:47,205
More wine?

277
00:18:47,656 --> 00:18:49,214
Oh, I think so.

278
00:18:57,096 --> 00:18:59,690
Those earrings look
really lovely on you.

279
00:19:01,856 --> 00:19:02,971
Thank you.

280
00:19:03,896 --> 00:19:04,965
They're yours.

281
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:07,852
Actually, they were Nana's.

282
00:19:12,296 --> 00:19:14,014
Now I'm depressed!

283
00:19:18,296 --> 00:19:20,412
Even more than I was.

284
00:19:27,856 --> 00:19:29,812
Hey, who's this little naked guy?

285
00:19:30,016 --> 00:19:32,052
That little naked guy would be me.

286
00:19:33,696 --> 00:19:35,288
Look at the little thing!

287
00:19:38,016 --> 00:19:40,484
Yes, fine.
That is my penis.

288
00:19:41,256 --> 00:19:43,008
Can we be grownups now?

289
00:19:43,696 --> 00:19:45,049
Who are those people?

290
00:19:45,296 --> 00:19:46,092
Got me.

291
00:19:46,376 --> 00:19:48,810
That's Nana right there in the middle.

292
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:50,971
Yeah, let's see.

293
00:19:51,216 --> 00:19:53,776
''Me and the gang at Java Joe's. ''

294
00:19:53,976 --> 00:19:56,046
Monica, you look just like
your grandmother.

295
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:57,411
How old was she there?

296
00:19:57,616 --> 00:19:59,447
Let's see, '' 1 939. ''

297
00:20:00,056 --> 00:20:01,614
Twenty-four, twenty-five.

298
00:20:02,896 --> 00:20:04,568
It looks like a fun gang.

299
00:20:10,216 --> 00:20:13,253
Look, look, look!
I got Monica naked!

300
00:20:13,456 --> 00:20:14,889
Let me see!

301
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:19,211
No, no. That would be me again.

302
00:20:23,896 --> 00:20:26,126
I'm just trying something.

303
00:20:37,016 --> 00:20:37,971
Hey, Lowell.

304
00:20:38,296 --> 00:20:39,570
Oh, hey, Chandler.

305
00:20:41,696 --> 00:20:44,051
So how's it going in
Financial Services?

306
00:20:44,296 --> 00:20:47,447
It's like Mardi gras without
the papier-mâché heads.

307
00:20:47,696 --> 00:20:48,731
How about you?

308
00:20:48,936 --> 00:20:50,813
Good. Good. Listen. . .

309
00:20:52,616 --> 00:20:55,608
. . .I don't know what Shelly told you
about me, but. . .

310
00:20:56,696 --> 00:20:58,015
. . .I'm not.

311
00:20:59,096 --> 00:21:01,212
I know. That's what I told her.

312
00:21:01,696 --> 00:21:02,811
Really?

313
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,768
So you can tell?

314
00:21:07,576 --> 00:21:11,774
Pretty much. Most of the time.
We have a kind of radar.

315
00:21:13,656 --> 00:21:15,453
So you don't think I have. . .

316
00:21:15,656 --> 00:21:16,486
. . .a quaIity?

317
00:21:17,296 --> 00:21:21,130
Speaking for my people,
I'd have to say no.

318
00:21:23,576 --> 00:21:26,693
By the way, your friend, Brian,
from Payroll? He is.

319
00:21:27,296 --> 00:21:28,251
He is?

320
00:21:28,456 --> 00:21:30,287
And way out of your league.

321
00:21:33,896 --> 00:21:35,409
Out of my league!

322
00:21:35,656 --> 00:21:39,615
I could get a Brian. If I wanted to
