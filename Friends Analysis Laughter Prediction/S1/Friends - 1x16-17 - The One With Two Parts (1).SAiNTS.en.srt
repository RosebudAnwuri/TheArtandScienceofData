00:00:06,573 --> 00:00:09,371
Unbelievable!
It's been half an hour.

2
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:13,068
If this was a cartoon,
you'd look like a ham now.

3
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:18,046
-There's the waitress. Hello, miss!
-It's Phoebe!

4
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:25,690
-Okay, will that be all?
-Wait. What are you doing here?

5
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:30,056
I was over there. Then you said,
"Hello, miss." So I'm here.

6
00:00:30,663 --> 00:00:33,063
No, how come you're working here?

7
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:37,430
Because it's close to where I live,
and the aprons are cute.

8
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:41,865
-Can we start over?
-Okay, I'm gonna be over here.

9
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:44,941
The One With Two Parts - Part l

10
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:34,126
I don't know whether
he's testing me...

11
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:38,058
... but my monkey is out of control!

12
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:42,064
He keeps erasing
the messages on my machine.

13
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:45,032
Supposedly by accident.

14
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:48,105
Oh, yeah, I've done that.

15
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:53,577
And then he got to
the newspaper before I did...

16
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,647
...and peed all over the crossword!

17
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,647
I've never done that.

18
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:04,689
Last night, I don't know what he did
but there were capers everywhere!

19
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:11,721
-She looks exactly like her sister.
-I'm saying I see a difference.

20
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:13,262
They're twins.

21
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:17,129
I don't care.
Phoebe's Phoebe. Ursula's hot!

22
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:21,538
You know how we talk about things?

23
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:24,437
-Let's not do that anymore.
-All right.

24
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:30,948
-Pheebs, guess who we saw today?
-Oh, fun! Okay.

25
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,584
-Liam Neeson.
-No.

26
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:34,184
-Morley Safer.
-No.

27
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:38,414
-The lady who cuts my hair!
-This could be a very long game.

28
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,685
-Your sister, Ursula.
-Oh, really?

29
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:44,887
-She works at that place....
-Riff's. I know.

30
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:49,330
You do? She said you guys
haven't talked in years.

31
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:54,601
So, is she fat?

32
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:58,834
Not from where I was standing.

33
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:01,411
Where were you standing?

34
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:06,614
Pheebs, so you guys
just don't get along?

35
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,545
It's mostly just dumb sister stuff.

36
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:13,157
Everyone always thought of her
as the pretty one.

37
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:20,891
She was the first to walk even
though I did it later that same day.

38
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:25,764
But to my parents, by then it was,
"Yeah, what else is new?"

39
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:29,975
I'm sorry. I've gotta go.
I've got Lamaze class.

40
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:33,873
And I've got earth science,
but I'll catch you in gym?

41
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:40,647
-ls this just gonna be you and Carol?
-Susan will be there too.

42
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:45,620
We've got dads, we've got lesbians.
The whole parenting team.

43
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:49,693
-lsn't that gonna be weird?
-lt might have been at first...

44
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,694
... but now I'm comfortable with it.

45
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,732
-Ross, that's my jacket.
-I know.

46
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:08,476
Hi. We're the Rostens.
I'm J. C. and he's Michael.

47
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:12,581
And we're having a boy and a girl.

48
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:15,276
Good for you.
All right, next?

49
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:22,956
I'm Ross Geller.
And that's my boy in there.

50
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:28,462
And this is Carol Willick.
And this is Susan Bunch.

51
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,727
Susan is Carol's....

52
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,841
Who's next?

53
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:42,246
Sorry, Susan is...?

54
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,575
-Carol's friend.
-Life partner.

55
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,752
Like buddies.

56
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,950
-Like lovers.
-You know how close women can get.

57
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:54,718
-We live together.
-I was married to her.

58
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:57,589
-Carol, not me.
-It's a bit complicated.

59
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,390
-But we're fine.
-Absolutely!

60
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,260
So, twins!
That's like two births.

61
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:09,504
Ouch!

62
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:17,409
to you too, Helen.

63
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:23,052
-Nina Bookbinder is here to see you.
-Okay, send her in.

64
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:31,554
-Come on in.
-You wanted to see me?

65
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:36,258
I was reviewing your data. You've
been postdating your Friday numbers.

66
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:41,736
-Which is bad, because...?
-lt throws my WENUS out of whack.

67
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:44,671
-Excuse me?
-WENUS.

68
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:47,744
Weekly Estimated Net Usage Statistics.

69
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:49,209
Gotcha!

70
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:54,682
Won't happen again. I wouldn't want
to do anything to hurt your WENUS.

71
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:03,719
I'll take "ldiots in the Workplace"
for 200, Alex.

72
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,991
It's not just that she's cute, okay?
It's just that...

73
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,761
...she's really, really cute.

74
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:15,464
It doesn't matter. You don't dip
your pen in the company ink.

75
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:19,967
God, I even know that
and I'm pretty much unemployable.

76
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:25,915
Ross, your little creature's got
the remote again.

77
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:29,248
Marcel, give Rossy the remote.

78
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,387
Marcel!

79
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:36,589
Marcel, you give Rossy
the remote right now!

80
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:42,300
You give Rossy the remote

81
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:44,993
-Great.
-Relax. I'll fix it.

82
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:52,505
Oh, cool!
Urkel in Spanish is Urkel.

83
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:57,177
How did he do this?

84
00:06:57,517 --> 00:07:02,477
Is leaving Christmas lights up your
plan to keep us merry all year long?

85
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:08,092
No, someone was supposed to take them
down but obviously someone forgot.

86
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:12,421
Someone was supposed to write,
"Rach, take down the lights"...

87
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:15,624
...and put it on the refrigera

88
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:21,502
-How long has that been there?
-A really long time.

89
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,137
-Where you been?
-Riff's.

90
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:28,074
I think Ursula likes me.
I ordered coffee.

91
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:32,274
She brought me a tuna melt
and four plates of curly fries.

92
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:35,851
Score.

93
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,280
She is so hot!

94
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:44,691
Before you do anything Joey-like,
you might want to run it by....

95
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,726
-Pheebs?
-Yeah.

96
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:52,496
Is it okay
if I asked out your sister?

97
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:55,902
Why? Why would you want
to do that? Why?

98
00:07:57,076 --> 00:08:00,170
So if we went out on a date,
she'd be there.

99
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:09,444
Well, I'm not my sister's,
you know, whatever.

100
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:13,523
And I mean, it's true,
we were one egg once.

101
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:18,186
But you know,
we've grown apart so....

102
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,393
I don't know. Why not?

103
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:22,825
Cool. Thanks.

104
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,663
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

105
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,243
Do you wanna watch
Laverne y Shirley?

106
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:49,018
Sorry.

107
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,498
Hi. Sorry I'm late.
Where's Carol?

108
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:55,928
Stuck at school.
Some parent-teacher thing.

109
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:58,831
You can go.
I'll get the information.

110
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:04,338
No, I think I should stay.
We should both know what's going on.

111
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,308
Oh, good. This will be fun.

112
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:12,109
We're gonna start with some basic
third-stage breathing exercises.

113
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:14,047
Moms, get on your back.

114
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:18,485
And coaches, you should
be supporting Mommy's head.

115
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:26,157
-What?
-What?

116
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:32,201
-I'm supposed to be the mommy?
-I'll play my sperm card once more.

117
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:37,468
I have to miss the coaching training
because I'm a woman?

118
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:40,805
-So, what do we do?
-I'll flip you for it.

119
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:44,107
Flip me for it? No, no.
Heads!

120
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:47,013
On your back, Mom!

121
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:54,986
All right, mommies, take a nice
deep, cleansing breath.

122
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:58,919
Good.

123
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:04,763
Now imagine your vagina is opening
like a flower.

124
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:18,610
-Mr. D! How's it going, sir?
-It's been better.

125
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:21,681
The Annual Net Usage
Statistics are in.

126
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:24,481
-And?
-It's pretty ugly.

127
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:28,387
We haven't seen an ANUS
this bad since the '70s.

128
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:32,991
-What does this mean?
-We'll be laying off people.

129
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:37,165
I know I was late last week.
But I slept funny and

130
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,669
Not you. Relax.

131
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,338
Ever have to fire anyone?

132
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:49,003
No, but that's not a problem.
That's why my name's on the door.

133
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:52,874
Do you know when I'm getting
my name on the door?

134
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:55,849
I don't know.
I put it in the thing.

135
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:59,691
It's okay.
So, who is it gonna be?

136
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,649
Nina!

137
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,785
Nina.

138
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:07,822
Nina.

139
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:13,469
Are you okay?

140
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:16,968
Yes. Yes, I am.

141
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:22,146
Listen, the reason that
I called you in here today was....

142
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,680
Please don't hate me.

143
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:26,442
What?

144
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:31,186
Would you like
to have dinner sometime?

145
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,856
So, what do you want
for your birthday?

146
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:42,600
What I want is for my mom
to be alive and enjoy it with me.

147
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:51,202
Okay. Let me put it this way.
Anything from Crabtree & Evelyn?

148
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:55,574
-Bath salts would be nice!
-Okay! Good.

149
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,080
What is this place?

150
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:10,227
You're cold, I have to pee and
there's coffee. How bad could it be?

151
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:12,954
I think we have an answer.

152
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:15,366
Why is she here?

153
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:19,231
This could be God's way
of telling us to eat at home.

154
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:23,305
-Think Riff's fired her?
-No, we were there last night.

155
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:26,307
Are you gonna go to the...?

156
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:31,347
-I'll wait till we order. It's her.
-lt looks like her.

157
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,984
-Excuse me?
-Yeah.

158
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:36,154
Hi, it's us!

159
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:42,024
Right. And it's me!

160
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:48,159
-So you're here too?
-As much as you are.

161
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,061
Your turn.

162
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,001
-We know what we want.
-That's good.

163
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:57,004
-Two caffe lattes.
-And some biscotti.

164
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:59,140
Good choice.

165
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:05,373
-It's definitely her.
-Yeah.

166
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:17,593
I can't believe you haven't told
that girl she doesn't have a job.

167
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:21,032
You haven't taken down
the Christmas lights.

168
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:25,769
Congratulations! You've found
the world's thinnest argument.

169
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,604
I'm finding the right moment.

170
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:32,209
That shouldn't be so hard
now that you're dating.

171
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:37,440
"Honey, you're fired. But how
about a quickie before I go to work?"

172
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:48,723
Once you're inside,
you don't have to knock anymore.

173
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,460
I'll get it.

174
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:57,867
-Hi, Mr. Heckles.
-You're doing it again.

175
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:02,901
We're not doing anything.
We're sitting and talking quietly.

176
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,803
I can hear you through the ceiling.

177
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:09,546
My cats can't sleep.

178
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:14,751
-You don't even have cats.
-I could have cats.

179
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:20,622
-Goodbye, Mr. Heckles.
-We'll try to keep it down.

180
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:29,433
Phoebe, do me a favor. Try this on.
I want to make sure it fits.

181
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:33,594
My first birthday present!
This is really

182
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:38,539
No, no, it's for Ursula.
I just figured size-wise....

183
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:42,938
Sure. Yeah. Okay, it fits.

184
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:48,948
-Are you seeing her again?
-Yep, lce Capades.

185
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:54,217
This is serious. I've never known you
to pay for any kind of "capade."

186
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:57,928
I don't know. I like her.

187
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:01,463
She's different.
There's something about her

188
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:05,103
That you like.
We get it. You like her. Great!

189
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:08,568
Phoebe, I asked you.
You said it was okay.

190
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:10,742
Maybe now it's not okay.

191
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:15,572
Okay. Maybe now I'm not okay
with it not being okay.

192
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:17,248
Okay!

193
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:24,954
IKnit, good woman, knit!

194
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:40,367
And that's the Chrysler Building
right there.

195
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:44,937
-Nina!
-Mr. Douglas. Cool tie.

196
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,447
She's still here.

197
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:54,076
Yes. Yes, she is.
Didn't I memo you on this?

198
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:59,189
After I let her go, I got a call
from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flennan

199
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:02,155
Dr. Flennan
Dr. Flynn.

200
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:06,457
And he informed me that
she took the news rather badly.

201
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:09,532
In fact, he mentioned
the word "frenzy."

202
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:14,635
-You're kidding! She seems so
-No. Nina? She's

203
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:17,472
If you asked her now...

204
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:22,136
...she'd have no recollection
of being fired at all.

205
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:25,545
-That's unbelievable.
-And yet believable.

206
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:31,887
So I decided not to fire her again
until she'll be no threat to anyone.

207
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:37,053
I guess you never know what's
going on inside a person's head.

208
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:41,455
Well, I guess that's why
they call it psychology, sir.

209
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:47,032
The sound Mom and Dad
will never forget.

210
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:50,470
For this, after all,
is the miracle of birth.

211
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,736
Lights, please.
And that's having a baby.

212
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:56,471
Next week is our final class.

213
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,742
Susan, go deep.

214
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:08,587
-It's just impossible.
-What is, honey?

215
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:12,286
What that woman did.

216
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:16,899
I am not doing that.
It'll just have to stay in.

217
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:20,503
Everything will be the same.
It'll just stay in.

218
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:25,302
-Carol, honey, it'll be all right.
-What do you know?

219
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:31,143
No one's asking you, "Mind if we push
this pot roast through your nostril?"

220
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:36,118
Carol, sweetie. Cleansing breath.

221
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:39,983
I know it's frightening.
But big picture:

222
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,693
The birth part is just one day.

223
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:47,264
When it's over, we'll all be
parents for the rest of our lives.

224
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:52,169
I mean, that's what this is
all about, right? Ross?

225
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:53,898
Ross?

226
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,635
I'm gonna be a father.

227
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,875
-This is news to you?
-I knew I was having a baby.

228
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,675
I just never realized
the baby was having me.

229
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:07,784
-You'll be great.
-How can you say that?

230
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:12,150
I can't even get Marcel
to stop eating the bathmat.

231
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:16,585
-How will I raise a kid?
-Some scientists are now saying...

232
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:20,561
...that monkeys and babies
are actually different.

233
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:26,398
You might want to look into it.

234
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:29,006
-Where you going?
-Out.

235
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,766
With...?

236
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:32,341
Yes.

237
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:35,203
Can I just ask you one question?

238
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:39,009
Have you two, you know,
like, you know?

239
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:43,880
You know, yet?

240
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:48,517
Not that it's any of your business,
but no, we haven't.

241
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,465
You meant sex, right?

242
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,445
-Do you have a sec?
-Sure. What's up?

243
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:17,481
The past few days, people have been
avoiding me and giving me weird looks.

244
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:23,851
Well, maybe that's because
they're jealous of us.

245
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:29,259
Maybe. But that doesn't explain
why they keep taking my scissors.

246
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:33,736
Maybe that's because
you're getting a big raise!

247
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,134
-I am?
-Sure. Why not?

248
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:40,436
Oh, my God! You're amazing!

249
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:42,904
You don't know.

250
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:47,244
Helen, do the paperwork
on Miss Bookbinder's raise.

251
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:52,317
You still want me to send her
psychological profile to Personnel?

252
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,984
Helen drinks.

253
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,560
Will you marry me?

254
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:07,805
So after the proposal,
I kind of unraveled.

255
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,643
Right. Because you were really
in control up until then.

256
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:16,505
-I told her everything.
-How'd she take it?

257
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,741
Pretty well.
Except for the stapler thing.

258
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:22,921
A tip. If you're ever
in a similar situation...

259
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:26,557
... never, ever leave your hand
on the desk.

260
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:30,650
Okay, I think I get how to do this.

261
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:40,202
Can we turn it off? Make them
go away because I can't watch.

262
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,305
Okay, they're gone.

263
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:44,735
Are you all right?

264
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:48,879
It's just this whole
stupid Ursula thing.

265
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:54,185
Pheebs, can I ask? So he's going out
with her. Is it really so terrible?

266
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:55,751
Yeah.

267
00:20:57,456 --> 00:21:00,619
I'm not saying she's evil or anything.

268
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:04,387
She's just always breaking my stuff.

269
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:10,398
When I was 8, she threw my Judy Jetson
Thermos under the bus.

270
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:14,333
And then when I was 1 2,
she broke my collarbone.

271
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:18,936
She didn't mean to do it
but I think it still counts.

272
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:23,375
And then there's Randy Brown,
who was like

273
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:27,643
Have you ever had a boyfriend
who was your best friend?

274
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,753
That's what he was for me.

275
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:38,555
And she kind of stole him away
and then broke his heart.

276
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:41,997
Then he wouldn't talk to me anymore.

277
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:47,934
He didn't want to be around anything
that looked like either one of us.

278
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:55,141
I know Joey's not my boyfriend
or my thermos...

279
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:57,042
...or anything, but

280
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:01,910
-You won't lose him.
-You gotta talk to Joey.

281
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:07,080
-lf he knew how you felt
-But he's falling in love with her.

282
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:09,351
They've been going out a week.

283
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:14,464
They haven't even slept together yet.
That's not serious.

284
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:18,669
Okay. Okay.

285
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,521
May we help you?

286
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:54,436
What are you doing?
It's freezing! Come inside.

287
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:59,235
No, you wanted me to take them down...

288
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:03,005
...so I'm taking them down, okay?

289
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:05,412
Rachel!

290
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:09,921
I'm okay. I'm okay.

291
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:12,120
Mr. Heckles?

292
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:15,691
Mr. Heckles, could you
help me, please?

293
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:19,922
This is just the kind of thing
I was talking about.

294
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:31,367
My friend was taking down
Christmas lights...

295
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:34,807
...and may have broken her ankle.

296
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:38,744
My God, you still have
your Christmas lights up?

297
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:43,817
-Fill this out and bring it back.
-Here you go.

298
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:53,228
All right. Name, address.

299
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:56,901
-Are you currently on any medication?
-No.

300
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,900
Oh, wait! Yes. Blistex.

301
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:06,510
-No. In case of emergency, call...?
-You.

302
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:10,046
-Really?
-Yeah.

303
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:13,149
Oh, that is so sweet!

304
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:18,320
Gosh, love you. Okay, insurance?

305
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:22,482
Oh, yeah, check it.
Definitely gonna want some of that!

306
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:25,925
-You don't have insurance?
-How much will this cost?

307
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,929
X-rays alone could be $200!

308
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:32,968
-What are we gonna do?
-There's not much we can do.

309
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,903
Unless I use yours.

310
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:40,669
-No, no, no.
-Now wait a second.

311
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:44,076
Who did I just put
as my emergency person?

312
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:46,216
That's insurance fraud.

313
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:52,746
All right then, forget it.
Might as well just go home.

314
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:57,691
-Okay, come here. I hate this.
-Thank you. I love you.

315
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:03,092
Hi. I'm gonna need
a new set of these forms.

316
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:07,936
-Why?
-I am really an idiot.

317
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:11,867
I was filling out her form...

318
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:15,604
...and instead of putting
her information I put mine.

319
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:18,078
You are an idiot.

320
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:22,481
Yep, that's me. I am that stupid.

321
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:27,421
I had a dream. I was playing
football with my kid.

322
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:31,460
-That's nice.
-No, no. With him.

323
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:38,893
I'm on this field,
and they hike me the baby.

324
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:44,007
I've gotta do something. The Tampa Bay
defense is coming right at me!

325
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:49,112
-Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.
-Right, but...

326
00:25:49,614 --> 00:25:54,415
...it is just me and the baby,
so I'm thinking they can take us.

327
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:59,522
And so I just heave it downfield!

328
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:04,491
-What are you, crazy? That's a baby!
-He should take the sack?

329
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:11,058
Anyway, suddenly I'm downfield.

330
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:15,205
And I realize I'm the one
who's supposed to catch him.

331
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:18,137
I know I'm not gonna
get there in time.

332
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:22,074
So I am running and running.
That is when I woke up.

333
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,716
See? I am so not ready
to be a father.

334
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,646
You're gonna be fine.

335
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:32,312
You're one of the most caring,
responsible men in North America.

336
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:34,789
You're gonna make a great dad.

337
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:38,621
Yeah, you and the baby
just need better blocking.

338
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:45,869
Have you ever been to
the Rainbow Room? Is it expensive?

339
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:48,938
Well, only if you order stuff.

340
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:52,367
I'm taking Ursula tonight.
It's her birthday.

341
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:55,705
-What about Phoebe's birthday?
-When's that?

342
00:26:57,315 --> 00:27:02,309
-Tonight.
-What are the odds of that happening?

343
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:05,790
You take your time.

344
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:13,460
There it is!

345
00:27:16,534 --> 00:27:19,367
-What'll you do?
-What can I do?

346
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:22,131
I don't wanna screw it up with Ursula.

347
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,466
And your friend?

348
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:27,577
If she's my friend, she'll understand.
Wouldn't you?

349
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:30,179
If you tried that on my birthday...

350
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:33,681
...you'd be staring at
the end of a hissy fit.

351
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:39,346
Saffron makes all the difference.

352
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:46,221
-Okay. Monica?
-Yes.

353
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:51,568
-Yes, she is.
-Hi, this is my friend Rachel.

354
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:54,864
-Hi, I'm Dr. Mitchell.
-And I'm Dr. Rosen.

355
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:56,802
I'm okay here.

356
00:27:57,008 --> 00:28:00,739
Actually, that's all right.
You can take your break.

357
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:06,281
No, this is why I became a doctor.
Ankles and stuff like that.

358
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:10,446
-Aren't you too cute to be a doctor?
-Excuse me?

359
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:16,116
God, young, young. I meant young.
Young to be a doctor. Good, Rach.

360
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:17,988
-Thank you.
-Right.

361
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,832
He said it was just a sprain.

362
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:32,032
-You left out the stupid part.
-It's not stupid.

363
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:36,644
The cute doctors asked us out
for tomorrow, and I said yes.

364
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:40,146
I think it's insane.
They work for the hospital.

365
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:43,718
It's like returning
to the scene of the crime.

366
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:47,983
-I say we blow off the dates.
-What? They are cute.

367
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:51,959
They are doctors. Cute doctors.
Doctors who are cute.

368
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:55,098
All right, what have
we learned so far?

369
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:58,903
Oh, God. Okay.

370
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:05,807
Surprise!

371
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:16,285
What are you doing?
You scared the crap out of me!

372
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:22,357
-Was that the cake?
-Yeah. I got a lemon schmoosh.

373
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,085
Come on. She'll be here any minute.

374
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:27,696
Hope it's okay.

375
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:34,171
"Happy Birthday Peehee."

376
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:37,669
Maybe we can make a "B" out of a rose.

377
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:40,606
We'll just use
our special cake tools.

378
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:43,007
-What's going on?
-We just

379
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:45,273
Surprise!

380
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:53,953
This is so great! Oh, my God!
This was not at all scary.

381
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,720
Look! "Happy Birthday Peehee."

382
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:01,262
What a strange new nickname.
I like it! Oh, my God!

383
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:04,594
Hi, everybody. Hi, Betty! Betty, hi!

384
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:08,102
You found Betty!
Oh, my gosh! This is so great.

385
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:13,675
Everybody I love is in the same room.
Where's Joey?

386
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,941
Did you see Betty?

387
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:32,727
I wouldn't mind having a piece
of this sun-dried tomato business.

388
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:37,766
Five years ago, if somebody had said,
"A tomato that's like a prune"...

389
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:40,631
... I'd have said, "Get out!"

390
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:46,108
Dad, before I was born,
did you freak out?

391
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:50,748
I'm not freaking out! I'm saying,
if someone had come to me

392
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:54,817
Dad, I'm talking about
the whole baby thing.

393
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:57,886
Did you ever get this sort of...

394
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:02,217
... panicky, "Oh, my God,
I'm gonna be a father" thing?

395
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:06,623
No. We just had kids back then.

396
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:12,394
We didn't think about it.
What else could the sun dry, I wonder?

397
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:14,094
Dad, come on. IKids.

398
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:19,299
Look, your mother really did the work.
I was busy with the business.

399
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:23,571
I wasn't around that much.
Is that what this is about?

400
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:25,544
No, I was just wondering.

401
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:29,186
We can make up for that.
We can do stuff together.

402
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:34,448
You always wanted to go to Colonial
Williamsburg. Let's do that.

403
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:39,187
Thanks, Dad, really.
You know, I just....

404
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:42,128
I just needed to know...

405
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:45,894
...when did you start
to feel like a father?

406
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:51,774
Well, I guess it must've been
the day after you were born.

407
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:55,710
We were in the hospital room,
your mom was asleep...

408
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:59,475
...and they brought you in
and gave you to me.

409
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:03,120
You were this ugly little red thing.

410
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:07,519
All of a sudden you grabbed
my finger with your fist...

411
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:11,593
...and you squeezed it so tight.

412
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:15,530
And that's when I knew.

413
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:21,401
So you don't wanna go
to Williamsburg?

414
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:26,406
We can go to Williamsburg.

415
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:29,740
Eat your fish.

416
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:37,547
-Rachel, the cute doctors are here!
-Okay, coming.

417
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:40,451
-Hi, come on in.
-Hi, Jeffrey.

418
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:42,818
We brought wine.

419
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:47,487
Look. It's from the cellars
of Ernest and Tova Borgnine.

420
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,960
-How could we resist?
-That's great!

421
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:53,800
-Monica, how's the ankle?
-It's....

422
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:59,403
Why don't you tell them?
After all, it is your ankle.

423
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:02,704
It's feeling a lot better.
Thank you.

424
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:06,712
Why don't you guys sit down,
and we'll get you some glasses?

425
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:10,115
Okay. Stat!

426
00:33:13,224 --> 00:33:18,526
Why don't we just tell them
who we really are? It'll be fine.

427
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:22,928
-We'll get in trouble.
-Would you stop being such a wuss?

428
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:27,002
A wuss? Excuse me
for living in the real world.

429
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:29,503
-So?
-So they still seem normal.

430
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:31,072
Because they are.

431
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:34,506
When we go out with women
from the hospital

432
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:39,945
Relax. Take a look around.
There are no pagan altars.

433
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:46,122
No piles of bones in the corners.
They're fine. Go like this:

434
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:54,063
We're not going to do it.
Sometimes you can be such a baby!

435
00:33:54,265 --> 00:33:57,496
-I am not a baby.
-Be serious. Every time

436
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,830
-You act like a princess.
-You know what?

437
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:06,705
Every day you are becoming more
and more like your mother. Excuse me.

438
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:08,378
Here we go.

439
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,308
Great place.
How long have you lived here?

440
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:15,486
I've been here about six years.

441
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:18,985
And Rachel moved in a few months ago.

442
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:25,185
See, I was supposed to get married,
but I left the guy at the altar.

443
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:30,162
-Really?
-Yeah.

444
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:36,102
Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish,
but hey, that's me!

445
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:43,146
-Try the hummus.
-Monica, what do you do?

446
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:46,646
I am a chef at a restaurant uptown.

447
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:49,877
-Good for you.
-Yeah, it is.

448
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:56,222
Mostly because I get to boss people
around, which I just love to do.

449
00:34:57,862 --> 00:35:01,593
-This hummus is great.
-God bless the chickpea.

450
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:10,364
Oh, God! I am so spoiled!

451
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:16,203
That's it.

452
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,245
I shoplift.

453
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:26,414
You had no idea that lipstick
was in your pocket.

454
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:30,788
Did I tell you that I think
I'm so much cuter than I am?

455
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:36,161
And have I mentioned that back
in high school I was a cow?

456
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:40,961
I used to wet my bed.

457
00:35:41,405 --> 00:35:44,306
I use my breasts
to get people's attention.

458
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:46,440
We both do that!

459
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:03,488
Monica and Rachel's apartment.

460
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:07,758
Just one second.
Rachel, it's your dad.

461
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:14,627
Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me.

462
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,869
Listen, Dad, I can't talk right now.

463
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:20,168
But there's something....

464
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:23,370
There's something
I've been meaning to tell you.

465
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:27,415
-Excuse me.
-Remember back in freshman year?

466
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:31,054
Well, Billy Dreskin
and I had sex on your bed.

467
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:43,693
Daddy.

468
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:47,136
Why? Why would I sleep
with Billy Dreskin?

469
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:51,933
His father tried to put you
out of business! You are dead!

470
00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:56,477
Hey, Rachel? Are these your condoms?

471
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:04,618
Oh, no, that was just Monica.
She's drunk again.

472
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:10,519
I don't think "scrunchy" is a word.

473
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:13,629
Why not, if "crunchy" is a word?

474
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:18,795
Then I'm using that same argument
for "fligament."

475
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:24,735
-Ross, he's got the remote again.
-Good.

476
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:28,002
Maybe he can switch it back.

477
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:32,673
Maybe not.

478
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:36,281
Okay, Daddy? That's the other line.

479
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:39,354
Okay, no, not even in my bedroom.

480
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:43,721
Okay. Okay. Bye-bye.

481
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,327
Hello?

482
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:52,894
Hold on a second. Let me check
and see if she's here.

483
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:57,370
It's the woman from the hospital.
There's a problem.

484
00:37:57,575 --> 00:38:00,874
-What do we do?
-Just find out what they want.

485
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:03,171
Okay. No, you do it.

486
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:08,185
Hello. This is Monica. Yeah?

487
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:12,345
Oh, okay. Yes, we'll be right down.
Thank you.

488
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:16,719
We forgot to sign one
of the admissions forms.

489
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:22,263
You were right. This was just
not worth it. Let me just change.

490
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:25,893
-"Garge"?
-Nautical term.

491
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:28,435
-Cheating man.
-Okay.

492
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,476
-She still didn't call?
-No.

493
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,238
Trouble?

494
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:40,146
Your sister stood me up.

495
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:44,014
Don't you hate it
when people aren't there for you?

496
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:49,282
-What is that?
-"Tushy."

497
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:54,660
-Did you try calling her?
-For two days.

498
00:38:54,865 --> 00:38:57,629
At the restaurant
they said she was busy.

499
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:00,565
I can't believe she's blowing me off!

500
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:21,219
-We had the two chef salads.
-And how were they?

501
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:28,031
No, we haven't had them yet.
We're still hoping to have them.

502
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:29,529
Okay.

503
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:45,947
-You got a minute?
-Yeah, I'm just working.

504
00:39:54,258 --> 00:39:55,987
So.

505
00:39:57,695 --> 00:40:01,722
-I got you a birthday present.
-Wow, you remembered.

506
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:11,134
-It's a Judy Jetson thermos.
-Like the kind you

507
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:15,335
Right. Oh, I got
something for you too.

508
00:40:15,546 --> 00:40:20,882
-How'd you know I was coming?
-Yeah, twin thing.

509
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:24,678
I can't believe you did this.

510
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:28,791
I can't believe you did this.

511
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:35,062
So, what's the deal with you and Joey?

512
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:40,200
Oh, right. He is so great.
But that's over.

513
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:42,971
-Does he know?
-Who?

514
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:48,471
Joey. You know,
he's really nutsy about you.

515
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:51,739
-He is? Why?
-You got me.

516
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:56,909
Right. Excuse me, doesn't this
come with a side salad?

517
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,223
So are you gonna call him?

518
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:03,325
-You think he likes me?
-No. Joey.

519
00:41:03,527 --> 00:41:08,328
Oh! No, he is so smart.
He'll figure it out.

520
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:10,794
Do you want some chicken?

521
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:13,367
No. No food with a face.

522
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:18,833
-You have not changed.
-Yeah, you too.

523
00:41:19,276 --> 00:41:23,713
Thanks. Excuse me? My side salad?

524
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:29,581
Service here is horrible.
Now I know what people mean.

525
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:33,947
Hi! Remember us?

526
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:39,593
You called about needing
a signature on the form?

527
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,298
Well, it turns out we need a new one.

528
00:41:42,566 --> 00:41:47,265
Because, you see,
I put the wrong name again.

529
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:51,396
-Because
-You're that stupid!

530
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:55,141
I am. I'm that stupid.

531
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,837
And I'm gonna pay
for this with a check.

532
00:41:58,048 --> 00:42:00,107
Your insurance will cover that.

533
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:03,047
I know. I'm just not
that bright either.

534
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:12,790
Mon, I'm sorry. I don't think
you're like your mother.

535
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:16,455
That's all right. And I don't
think you were selfish.

536
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:20,028
Oh, and I'm sorry I said
you were a cow.

537
00:42:20,237 --> 00:42:23,263
That's okay, I was a cow.

538
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:28,104
I know. I'm just sorry I said it.

539
00:42:29,246 --> 00:42:34,309
Worst case scenario:
Say you never feel like a father.

540
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:38,750
Say your son never feels
connected to you as one.

541
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:42,585
Say all of his relationships
are affected by this.

542
00:42:42,793 --> 00:42:47,856
-Do you have a point?
-You know, you'd think I would.

543
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:53,067
What's up with the simian?

544
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:56,797
-It's just a fur ball.
-All right.

545
00:42:57,741 --> 00:43:01,575
-Whose turn?
-Yours. I got 43 points for "kidney."

546
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:05,340
No, you got zero points for "idney."

547
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:08,541
I had a "K." Where's my "K"?

548
00:43:14,825 --> 00:43:17,885
You've got to help me!
My monkey swallowed a "K"!

549
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:23,226
-Get that animal out!
-The animal hospital is across town.

550
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:26,926
-What's going on?
-Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.

551
00:43:28,238 --> 00:43:31,298
Excuse me.
This hospital is for people!

552
00:43:31,508 --> 00:43:34,272
He is people! He has a name, okay?

553
00:43:34,478 --> 00:43:39,711
He watches Jeopardy!, he touches
himself when nobody's watching.

554
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:41,847
Please, have a heart.

555
00:43:42,052 --> 00:43:44,282
-I'll take a look at him.
-Thanks.

556
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:45,580
-Michael!
-Rachel.

557
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,848
-What?
-Monica.

558
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:07,839
Urs, what are you doing here?
I've been trying to call you.

559
00:44:08,045 --> 00:44:09,273
Listen....

560
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:14,474
Don't say "listen."
I know that "listen." I've said that.

561
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:18,777
-I'm sorry.
-I don't get it. What happened?

562
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,981
What about what
you said under the bridge?

563
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:28,062
Yeah. You should just forget about
what I said under the bridge.

564
00:44:28,265 --> 00:44:31,996
I was talking crazy that night.
I was so drunk.

565
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:37,105
-You don't drink.
-That's right, I don't.

566
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:41,435
-But I was drunk on you.
-Oh, Urs

567
00:44:41,645 --> 00:44:43,374
But it's not gonna work.

568
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:47,881
Why? Is it because
I'm friends with Phoebe?

569
00:44:48,085 --> 00:44:50,781
Would you stop hanging out with her?

570
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:55,949
No, I couldn't do that.

571
00:44:57,127 --> 00:45:00,028
Then yeah, it's because of Phoebe.

572
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:03,858
So, you know, it's either her or me.

573
00:45:06,403 --> 00:45:08,564
Then I'm sorry.

574
00:45:12,743 --> 00:45:16,941
You know, you're gonna be
really hard to get over.

575
00:45:17,748 --> 00:45:19,215
I know.

576
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:29,523
I don't know whether it's just
because we're breaking up or what.

577
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:34,061
-But you've never looked so beautiful.
-Really?

578
00:46:04,228 --> 00:46:05,820
-Pheebs?
-Yeah.

579
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:18,798
He looks so tiny.

580
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:21,341
-We just heard.
-ls he okay?

581
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:24,070
The doctor got the "K" out.

582
00:46:24,348 --> 00:46:27,545
He also found an "M" and an "O."

583
00:46:28,485 --> 00:46:31,750
We think he was trying
to spell out "monkey."

584
00:46:37,928 --> 00:46:41,591
The doctor says he'll be fine.
He's just sleeping now.

585
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:46,294
-So, you feel like a dad yet?
-No. Why?

586
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:50,573
Come on, you came through.
You did what you had to do.

587
00:46:50,774 --> 00:46:53,971
-That's very "dad."
-Look. He's waking up.

588
00:46:54,178 --> 00:46:56,772
Hey, fella. How you doing?

589
00:46:57,772 --> 00:47:07,772
