1
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,720
Oh, look! There's Joey's picture!

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,200
This is so exciting!

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,240
You can spot someone who's
never seen his plays.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,840
Notice, no fear.
No sense of impending doom.

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,200
The exclamation point scares me.

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,720
It's not just Freud, it's Freud!

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,440
Magic is about to happen!

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,640
Well, Eva...

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,840
...we've done
some excellent work here.

10
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,000
And I would have to say...

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:36,320
...your problem is quite clear.

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,800
<i>All you want is a dinkle</i>

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,760
<i>What you envy's a schwang</i>

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,160
<i>A thing through which you can tinkle</i>

15
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,920
<i>To play with or simply let hang</i>

16
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,160
FRIENDS

17
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,520
I feel violated.

18
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,720
Did anybody else feel like
peeling their skin off...

19
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,200
...to have something else to do?

20
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,440
Ross, 10:00.

21
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,440
Is it? It feels like 2.

22
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,880
-No, 1 0:00!
-What?

23
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,480
There's a beautiful woman
at 8, 9, 1 0:00!

24
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,200
Hello!

25
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,240
She's amazing!

26
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:14,000
She makes the women l
dream about look like fat, bald men.

27
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,840
Go over.
She's not with anyone.

28
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,840
And what would my opening line be?

29
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,880
Excuse me...

30
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,080
Come on, she's a person.
You can do it.

31
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,160
Could she be more out of my league?
Back me up.

32
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,680
He couldn't get a woman
like that in a million years.

33
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,840
You always see these beautiful
women with "nothing" guys.

34
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,720
You could be one of those guys.

35
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,720
-You could do that.
-You think?

36
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,760
Absolutely!

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,520
I can't believe
I'm considering this.

38
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,240
-l' m very aware of my tongue.
-Come on.

39
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,120
Here goes.

40
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,080
-Yes?
-Hi. Okay, next word would be...

41
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,200
... Chandler.

42
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,280
Chandler is my name and....

43
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,800
Hi!

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,840
Yes, you said that.

45
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,880
Yes! Yes, I did.
But what I didn't say....

46
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,080
What I wanted to say was...

47
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,800
...would you like to go out with me?
Thank you. Good night.

48
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,680
Chandler?

49
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,760
-I didn't know you could dance!
-You were in a play!

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,040
What'd you think?

51
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,240
-I didn't know you could dance!
-You were in a play!

52
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,000
It wasn't that bad.
I was the lead.

53
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,200
It was better than the troll thing.
At least you got to see my head.

54
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,520
-You're right.
-We saw your head.

55
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,400
She said yes!
She said yes!

56
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,680
Awful play, man!

57
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,320
Her name's Aurora. She's ltalian
and she pronounces my name " Chandler. "

58
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,800
I like that better.
The usher gave me this.

59
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,960
-What is it?
-The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency.

60
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,880
An agency left its card.
They wanna sign me!

61
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,720
Based on this play?

62
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,160
Based on this play!

63
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,440
Hey kids!

64
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,040


65
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,600
It's been seven seconds, and you
haven't asked me how my date went.

66
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,320
How was your date, Chandler?

67
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,720
It was unbelievable!

68
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,520
I've never met anyone like her.
She's had an amazing life!

69
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,040
<i>She was in the Israeli army.</i>

70
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,440
None of the bullets hit the engine,

71
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,920
so we made it to the border.

72
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,800
But just barely, and l....

73
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,760
I've been talking about myself
all night long. I'm sorry.

74
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,600
What about you? Tell me a story.

75
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,000
All right, once...

76
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,840
... I got on the subway.

77
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,640
And it was at night...

78
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,040
...and I rode it all the way
to Brooklyn.

79
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,560
Just for the hell of it.

80
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,240
We talked until 2:00. It was perfect.

81
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,320
More or less.

82
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,000
Suddenly, we realized we were
in Yemen.

83
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,360
I' m sorry, so "we" is...?

84
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,800
"We" is me and Rick.

85
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,920
Who's Rick?

86
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,360
Who's Rick?

87
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,000
My husband.

88
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,840
-Oh, so you' re divorced?
-No.

89
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,160
I' m sorry. So you' re widowed?
Hopefully?

90
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,240
No, l' m still married.

91
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,840
So, how would your husband feel
about you sitting here with me...

92
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,120
...sliding your foot so far up my leg

93
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,280
you can count the change in my pocket?

94
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,600
Don't worry.

95
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:49,200
He'd be okay with you
because he's okay with Ethan.

96
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,440
Ethan? There's an Ethan?

97
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,840
Ethan is my...

98
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,960
...boyfriend.

99
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,720
What?

100
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,000
What kind of relationship
do you imagine us having...

101
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,360
...if you have a husband
and a boyfriend?

102
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,480
I suppose, mainly sexual.

103
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,160
Sorry it didn't work out.

104
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,520
What, not work out?
I'm seeing her again on Thursday.

105
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,680
Didn't you listen to the story?

106
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,160
Didn't YOU listen? It's twisted!

107
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,000
How could you get involved
with her?

108
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,480
I had trouble with it at first.
But I get the good stuff.

109
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,960
All the fun, all the talking,
all the sex...

110
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,280
...and none of the responsibility.

111
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,040
This is every guy's fantasy!

112
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,720
-That's not true!
-Ross, is this your fantasy?

113
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,080
No, of course not.

114
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,040
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

115
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,040
You'd go out with someone
going out with someone else?

116
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,040
I couldn't.

117
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,320
Good for you.

118
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,600
When l' m with a woman,
I need to know...

119
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,040
... I' m going out
with more people than her.

120
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,080
You know...

121
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,160
monogamy can be
a tricky concept.

122
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,280
I mean, anthropologically speaking

123
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,400
Fine. Now you'll never know.

124
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,120
We're kidding. Tell us.

125
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,840
-We wanna know.
-Come on!

126
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,240
All right. There's a theory
put forth by Richard Leakey

127
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,960
Are we greeting each other
this way now? I like it.

128
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,640
Look! I cleaned!

129
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,000
I did the windows.
I did the floors.

130
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,400
I used all the vacuum attachments
but the round one.

131
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,000
What's it for?

132
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,240
Nobody knows. 
And we're not supposed to ask.

133
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,640
What do you think?

134
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,960
-It's very clean.
-Really, it looks great!

135
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,760
I see you moved the green ottoman.

136
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,640
How did that happen?

137
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,240
I don't know. It looked better there.

138
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,000
And it's an extra seat
around the table.

139
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,560
Yeah, it's interesting.

140
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,840
But you know what? Just for fun...

141
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,840
...Iet's see what it looked like
in the old spot.

142
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,760
Just to compare.

143
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,400
Let's see.

144
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,720
Well, it looks good there too.

145
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,640
Let's leave it there for a while.

146
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,440
I can't believe you moved
the green ottoman.

147
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,760
Be glad you didn't fan the magazines.

148
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,800
She'll scratch your eyes out.

149
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,760
You guys, I am not that bad!

150
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,320
Yeah, you are.

151
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,000
Remember, I lived with you?

152
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,480
You were a little....

153
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,040
That is so unfair!

154
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:52,440
When we were kids, yours was the only
Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy.

155
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,160
Okay, so I'm responsible.
I'm organized.

156
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,640
But hey, I can be a kook!

157
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,920
All right, you madcap gal!

158
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,200
Imagine this.

159
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,000
The phone bill arrives,
but you don't pay it right away.

160
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,000
Why not?

161
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,200
Because you're a kook!

162
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,040
You wait until they send a notice.

163
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,400
I could do that.

164
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,400
Okay, then you let me
go grocery shopping

165
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,440
And I buy detergent,

166
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,840
but it's not the one
with the easy-pour spout.

167
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,120
Why would someone do that?

168
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,840
One might wonder.

169
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,640
A glass is on the table with no coaster.

170
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,040
 A cold drink. A hot day.

171
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,400
Beads of condensation are inching
closer to the wood...

172
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,120
Stop it!

173
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,640
Oh, my God!

174
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,960
It's true. Who am l?

175
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,640
Monica, you're Mom.

176
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,680
Oh, my God!

177
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,880
Okay, I'll be there.

178
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,680
That was my agent.

179
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:18,760
My agent has just gotten me a job
in the new Al Pacino movie!

180
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,600
That's great!

181
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,600
What's the part?

182
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,800
Can you believe it? Pacino!

183
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,760
This guy's why I became an actor!

184
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,240
" Out of order? You' re out of order!

185
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,960
This whole courtroom's out of order! "

186
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,800
Seriously, what's the part?

187
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,640
"Just when I thought I was out,
they pull me back in! "

188
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:42,280
Come on. Seriously, Joey,
what's the part?

189
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,680
You' re.... What?

190
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,440
I' m his butt double, okay?

191
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,120
I play Al Pacino's butt.

192
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,920
All right? He goes into the shower,
and then...

193
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,200
... I' m his butt.

194
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,640
Oh, my God!

195
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,000
Come on, you guys.

196
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,400
It's a real Pacino movie
and that's big!

197
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,960
It's terrific. You deserve this.

198
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,280
After years of struggling you've

199
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:18,080
cracked your way into show business.

200
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,920
Fine. Make jokes, I don't care.

201
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,520
This is a big break for me!

202
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,240
So, will you invite us
to the big opening?

203
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,680
So, will you invite us
to the big opening?

204
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,200
-I need some moisturizer.
-For what?

205
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,640
Today's the big day!

206
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,560
God. Go in the bathroom.
Use whatever you want.

207
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,640
Don't ever tell me what you did
in there.

208
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,320
Thank you.

209
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,640
-Joey's mom's on the phone.
-ln the bathroom.

210
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:02,680
-You don't wanna go in there!
-Come on, we' re roommates.

211
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,720
My eyes!
My eyes!

212
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,120
I warned you.

213
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,040
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,159
Who is being loud?

214
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,480
Oh, that would be Monica.

215
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,400
Can I borrow stuff?
I wanna make Aurora breakfast.

216
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,320
You got the whole night?

217
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,720
Well, I only have 20 minutes
until Ethan, so....

218
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,800
Do I sense resentment?

219
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,000
No. No resentment. Believe me...

220
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,200
...it's worth it, okay?

221
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,520
In a relationship, you have moments

222
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,120
you'll remember the rest of your life.

223
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,440
Every single second is like that
with Aurora.

224
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,040
I've just wasted 35 of them
talking to you.

225
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:44,240
So, Monica, can you
help me with the door?

226
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,920
The old Monica would remind you...

227
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,920
...to scrub that Teflon pan with
a plastic brush.

228
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,480
But l' m not gonna do that.

229
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,520
Everybody ready?

230
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:09,240
I wanna thank you
for this opportunity.

231
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,480
Lose the robe.

232
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,520
Me?

233
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,200
That would work.

234
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,400
Right. Okay. Losing the robe!

235
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,040
Okay, and the robe is lost.

236
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,920
I would like to get this in one take.

237
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,400
Let's roll it.

238
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,520
Water's working.

239
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,960
And action!

240
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,400
And cut!

241
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,240
Butt guy, what are you doing?

242
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,920
I'm showering.

243
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,120
No, that was clenching.

244
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,000
The way I see it,
the guy's upset here, you know?

245
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,360
His wife's dead,
his brother's missing.

246
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,840
I think his butt would be angry here.

247
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,400
I think his butt would like
to get the shot before lunch.

248
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:57,120
Once again, rolling.
Water working.

249
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,240
And action!

250
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,800
And cut!

251
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,840
What was that?

252
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,440
I was going for quiet desperation.

253
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,880
But if you have to ask....

254
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,600
God, I love these fingers.

255
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,920
Thank you.

256
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,400
No, actually, I meant my fingers.

257
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:27,480
Look at them.
Look at how happy they are.

258
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,840
-Oh, my God, l' m late!
-Oh, no!

259
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,560
-Don't go.
-Okay.

260
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,160
-I have to.
-Look, she's leaving.

261
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,800
I' m sorry. He'll be waiting for me.

262
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,600
I thought you talked to Rick.

263
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,600
It's not Rick.

264
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,040
Ethan? He gets the whole day!

265
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,200
No, it's Andrew.

266
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,960
I know there'll be moments...

267
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,960
...when I'll regret asking
the following question, but....

268
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,520
And Andrew is?

269
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,600
He's...

270
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,720
... new.

271
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:08,040
So you' re not completely fulfilled
by Rick, Ethan and myself?

272
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,600
No, that's not exactly what I was

273
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,600
Most women would kill...

274
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,960
...for three guys like us.

275
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,080
So, what do you want?

276
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,160
You.

277
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,360
-You have me.
-No. Just you.

278
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,400
What do you mean?

279
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,880
Lose the other guys.

280
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,440
Like, all of them?

281
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,720
Come on, we' re great together.
Why not?

282
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,760
Can't we have what we have now?

283
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,240
Why can't we talk and make love...

284
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,320
...without feeling obligated
to each other?

285
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,920
Up until tonight, I thought
that's what you wanted too.

286
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,960
Well, part of me wants that...

287
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,320
... but it's like l' m two guys.

288
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,240
One guy's saying, "This is great! "

289
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,120
But there's this other guy.

290
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,240
The guy who wells up
when the Grinch's heart grows...

291
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,600
...and breaks that measuring device.

292
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:06,440
He's saying, you know,
"This is too hard. Get out! "

293
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,240
So, which one of the guys
will you listen to?

294
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,440
I have to listen to both.
They don't let each other finish.

295
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,040
Which one?

296
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,800
The second guy.

297
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,560
I see.

298
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,280
Call me if you change your mind.

299
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,680
Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.

300
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:58,440
Look at it this way. You dumped her!

301
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,720
Right? I mean, this woman was

302
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,520
unbelievably sexy...

303
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:07,440
...and beautiful, intelligent,
unattainable.

304
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,480
Tell me why you did this again?

305
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,640
Movie star!

306
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:18,880
Wait! Aren't you the guy who plays
the butt in the new Pacino movie?

307
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,640
Nope.

308
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,200
No? What happened, big guy?

309
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,280
Big guy?

310
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,760
It felt like a "big guy" moment.

311
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,880
I got fired!

312
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,440
They said I acted too much with it.

313
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,400
I told everybody about this!

314
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,520
Everybody's expecting to see me.

315
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,240
No one will be able to tell.

316
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,480
My mom will.

317
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,840
There's something so sweet

318
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,200
and disturbing about that.

319
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,240
I've done crappy plays
for six years...

320
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,320
...and I finally get my shot,
and I blow it!

321
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,200
Maybe this wasn't it.

322
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:05,200
I think when it's your shot,
you know it's your shot.

323
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,920
Did it feel like your shot?

324
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,640
Hard to tell. I was naked.

325
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,360
I don't think this was it.

326
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,760
I don't think you just get one.

327
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,240
I believe things are gonna happen
for you. I do.

328
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,160
You've got to think about
the day some kid will go:

329
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:28,400
"l got the part!
I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass! "

330
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,080
You think? That's so nice.

331
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,160
I' m sorry, Joey.
I' m gonna go to bed, guys.

332
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,520
Good night.

333
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:46,360
You' re gonna leave
your shoes out here?

334
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,960
Really? Just casually
strewn about...

335
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,880
...in that reckless, haphazard manner?

336
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:02,280
It doesn't matter.
I'll get them tomorrow. Or not!

337
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,080
Whenever.

338
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,280
She is a kook.

339
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:27,680
<i>If it bothers you that much,
just go out and get the shoes.</i>

340
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,200
<i>No, don 't do this!</i>

341
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,800
<i>This is stupid!</i>

342
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,520
<i>I don 't have to prove anything.
I'm gonna get them.</i>

343
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,640
<i>But then everyone will know..</i>

344
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,120
<i>Unless I get them, then wake up
really early and put them back.</i>

345
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,360
<i>I need help!</i>

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
