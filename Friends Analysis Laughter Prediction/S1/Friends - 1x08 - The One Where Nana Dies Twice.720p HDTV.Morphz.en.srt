1
00:00:05,476 --> 00:00:07,626
Hey, gorgeous! How's it going?

2
00:00:07,876 --> 00:00:10,754
Dehydrated Japanese noodles
under fluorescent lights.

3
00:00:10,996 --> 00:00:13,146
Does it get better than this?

4
00:00:13,836 --> 00:00:16,145
Question: You're not dating, are you?

5
00:00:16,396 --> 00:00:18,864
I met somebody who would be
perfect for you.

6
00:00:19,316 --> 00:00:21,352
You see, perfect might be a problem.

7
00:00:21,596 --> 00:00:24,986
Had you said co-dependent
or self-destructive. . . .

8
00:00:25,716 --> 00:00:27,832
-You want a date Saturday?
-Yes, please.

9
00:00:29,716 --> 00:00:30,831
He is cute.

10
00:00:31,076 --> 00:00:33,146
-He's funny. He's--
-He's a he?

11
00:00:33,356 --> 00:00:34,709
Well, yeah.

12
00:00:34,996 --> 00:00:35,872
Oh, God!

13
00:00:36,156 --> 00:00:37,430
I just--

14
00:00:38,516 --> 00:00:39,744
You're nice-- Oh, God.

15
00:00:40,076 --> 00:00:43,625
Good, Shelly. I'm gonna go
flush myself down the toilet now.

16
00:00:43,876 --> 00:00:44,945
Okay. Bye-bye.

17
00:00:47,156 --> 00:00:49,192
The One Where Nana Dies Twice

19
00:01:31,676 --> 00:01:35,385
It's hard to enjoy Ramen noodles
after that. Is that ridiculous?

20
00:01:35,636 --> 00:01:38,104
Can you believe she actually
thought that?

21
00:01:43,276 --> 00:01:45,744
When I first met you,
I thought maybe. . .

22
00:01:45,996 --> 00:01:47,031
. . .possibly. . .

23
00:01:47,276 --> 00:01:48,265
. . .you might be.

24
00:01:49,516 --> 00:01:50,312
You did?

25
00:01:50,556 --> 00:01:53,753
Then you spent Phoebe's birthday
party talking to my breasts. . .

26
00:01:53,996 --> 00:01:55,714
. . .so then I figured maybe not.

27
00:01:57,356 --> 00:02:02,111
Did any of the rest of you guys
think that when you first met me?

28
00:02:02,316 --> 00:02:03,385
-I did.
-I think so.

29
00:02:05,996 --> 00:02:07,952
-Not me.
-No, no, me neither.

30
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:11,947
Although back in college,
Susan Saladore did.

31
00:02:12,196 --> 00:02:13,595
You're kidding.

32
00:02:14,036 --> 00:02:16,072
-Did you tell her I wasn't?
-No.

33
00:02:17,276 --> 00:02:19,744
It's because I wanted
to go out with her too.

34
00:02:19,956 --> 00:02:23,232
So I told her, actually,
you were seeing Bernie Spellman. . .

35
00:02:25,676 --> 00:02:26,904
. . .who also liked her.

36
00:02:31,716 --> 00:02:33,513
Well, this is fascinating.

37
00:02:34,276 --> 00:02:35,914
So what is it about me?

38
00:02:36,596 --> 00:02:39,713
I don't know. Because you're smart,
you're funny. . . .

39
00:02:39,956 --> 00:02:42,186
So is Ross.
You ever think that about him?

40
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:43,426
Yeah, right!

41
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:44,991
What is it?

42
00:02:47,036 --> 00:02:50,028
I don't know. You just--
You have a quality.

43
00:02:50,276 --> 00:02:51,106
Yes, exactly.

44
00:02:51,356 --> 00:02:52,709
Yeah, a quality.

45
00:02:53,396 --> 00:02:57,309
''A quality. '' Good. I was worried
you were gonna be vague about this.

46
00:03:04,556 --> 00:03:06,148
It's Paolo calling from Rome.

47
00:03:06,396 --> 00:03:09,194
Oh, my God! Calling from Rome!

48
00:03:14,156 --> 00:03:16,954
So he's calling from Rome.
I could do that.

49
00:03:17,476 --> 00:03:19,034
Just gotta go to Rome.

50
00:03:21,756 --> 00:03:24,350
Your Dad just beeped in.
Can you make it quick?

51
00:03:24,596 --> 00:03:26,109
I'm talking to Rome.

52
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,469
I'm talking to Rome.

53
00:03:29,556 --> 00:03:31,069
Hey, Dad. What's up?

54
00:03:32,996 --> 00:03:34,111
Oh, God.

55
00:03:35,676 --> 00:03:37,075
Ross, it's Nana.

56
00:03:48,356 --> 00:03:49,994
-How you doing?
-Hey, Dad.

57
00:03:53,756 --> 00:03:54,666
How's she doing?

58
00:03:55,396 --> 00:03:57,705
The doctor says
it's a matter of hours.

59
00:03:58,276 --> 00:04:00,949
-How are you, Mom?
-Me? I'm fine, fine.

60
00:04:01,196 --> 00:04:02,948
I'm glad you're here.

61
00:04:04,596 --> 00:04:05,915
What's with your hair?

62
00:04:06,156 --> 00:04:07,225
What?

63
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:08,752
What's different?

64
00:04:09,196 --> 00:04:10,072
Nothing.

65
00:04:10,596 --> 00:04:12,552
Oh, maybe that's it.

66
00:04:13,356 --> 00:04:14,835
She's unbelievable.
Her mother's--

67
00:04:15,036 --> 00:04:16,264
Okay, relax.

68
00:04:16,476 --> 00:04:18,910
We are gonna be here a while,
it looks like.

69
00:04:19,116 --> 00:04:21,835
We still have boyfriends
and your career to cover.

70
00:04:22,156 --> 00:04:23,350
Oh, God!

71
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:33,112
The fuzzy little mints
at the bottom of her purse.

72
00:04:33,956 --> 00:04:35,992
Yeah, they were gross.

73
00:04:36,796 --> 00:04:38,514
You know what I love?

74
00:04:38,716 --> 00:04:40,468
Her Sweet 'N Lows.

75
00:04:40,676 --> 00:04:43,748
How she was always stealing them
from restaurants.

76
00:04:43,996 --> 00:04:46,908
Not just from restaurants,
from our house.

77
00:04:47,636 --> 00:04:48,432
Mrs. Geller?

78
00:04:54,196 --> 00:04:55,470
She looks so small.

79
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:56,905
I know.

80
00:04:57,996 --> 00:05:01,306
Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop
and Aunt Phyllis now.

81
00:05:04,956 --> 00:05:06,435
Goodbye, Nana.

82
00:05:13,476 --> 00:05:14,272
Bye, Nana.

83
00:05:20,676 --> 00:05:21,711
Nurse!

84
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,430
What is going on?

85
00:05:25,276 --> 00:05:27,915
You know how the nurse said
Nana had passed?

86
00:05:28,116 --> 00:05:29,595
Well, she's not quite.

87
00:05:31,156 --> 00:05:31,952
What?

88
00:05:32,156 --> 00:05:35,785
She's not passed!
She's present! She's back!

89
00:05:36,156 --> 00:05:37,225
What's going on?

90
00:05:37,476 --> 00:05:39,068
She may have died.

91
00:05:39,876 --> 00:05:41,104
''She may have died''?

92
00:05:41,356 --> 00:05:42,584
We're looking into it.

93
00:05:44,476 --> 00:05:45,955
I'll go see.

94
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,554
This almost never happens.

95
00:06:07,316 --> 00:06:09,352
Now she's passed.

96
00:06:18,676 --> 00:06:20,792
I just have to know, okay?

97
00:06:21,356 --> 00:06:22,550
Is it my hair?

98
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:26,028
Yes, that's exactly what it is.
It's your hair.

99
00:06:26,276 --> 00:06:28,346
Yeah, you have homosexual hair.

100
00:06:34,996 --> 00:06:36,224
So did she. . .?

101
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,024
Twice.

102
00:06:40,116 --> 00:06:41,708
Oh, that sucks.

103
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:44,951
You guys okay?

104
00:06:45,396 --> 00:06:46,954
I don't know. It's weird.

105
00:06:47,196 --> 00:06:50,552
I know she's gone,
but I just don't feel. . . .

106
00:06:50,876 --> 00:06:52,673
Maybe she's not really gone.

107
00:06:52,876 --> 00:06:54,309
No, no, she's gone.

108
00:06:55,196 --> 00:06:56,424
We checked.

109
00:06:56,876 --> 00:06:57,865
A lot.

110
00:06:59,196 --> 00:07:01,949
No, I mean, maybe no one
ever really goes.

111
00:07:02,196 --> 00:07:04,949
Ever since my mom died,
every now and then. . .

112
00:07:05,196 --> 00:07:08,791
. . .I get this feeling that she's,
like, right here, you know?

113
00:07:12,676 --> 00:07:15,110
And Debbie, my best friend
from junior high. . .

114
00:07:15,316 --> 00:07:18,308
. . .got struck by lightning
on a miniature golf course.

115
00:07:19,596 --> 00:07:21,951
I always get this strong
Debbie vibe. . .

116
00:07:22,196 --> 00:07:24,505
. . .whenever I use
a little yellow pencil.

117
00:07:29,476 --> 00:07:30,226
I miss her.

118
00:07:31,396 --> 00:07:32,545
Here, Pheebs.

119
00:07:32,796 --> 00:07:33,751
Want this?

120
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:35,952
-Oh, thanks.
-Sure.

121
00:07:36,196 --> 00:07:38,312
I just sharpened her this morning.

122
00:07:40,516 --> 00:07:43,508
I don't believe any of that.
I think when you're dead. . .

123
00:07:43,756 --> 00:07:46,145
. . .you're dead. You're gone.
You're worm food.

124
00:07:50,276 --> 00:07:51,914
So Chandler looks gay, huh?

125
00:07:55,996 --> 00:07:58,715
I don't know who this is,
but it's not Debbie.

126
00:08:06,076 --> 00:08:07,907
I thought it'd be a closed casket.

127
00:08:08,116 --> 00:08:10,949
Well, that doesn't mean
she can't look nice.

128
00:08:15,676 --> 00:08:18,144
Sweetie, you think
you can get in there?

129
00:08:18,556 --> 00:08:20,194
I don't see why not.

130
00:08:38,596 --> 00:08:39,711
Here's my retainer!

131
00:08:48,876 --> 00:08:50,468
I was just thinking. . .

132
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:52,593
-. . .when my time comes--
-Dad!

133
00:08:52,836 --> 00:08:53,985
Listen to me!

134
00:08:55,596 --> 00:08:59,225
When my time comes,
I wanna be buried at sea.

135
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:02,712
You what?

136
00:09:03,596 --> 00:09:06,668
I wanna be buried at sea.
It looks like fun.

137
00:09:08,876 --> 00:09:10,104
Define ''fun. ''

138
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:14,275
Come on. You'll make a day of it.
You'll get a boat, pack a lunch. . . .

139
00:09:14,556 --> 00:09:18,708
And then we throw your body in
the water. Gee, that does sound fun.

140
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:20,349
Everyone thinks they know me.

141
00:09:20,596 --> 00:09:23,554
Everyone says, ''Jack Geller,
so predictable. ''

142
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:28,347
Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say,
''Buried at sea? Huh. ''

143
00:09:31,596 --> 00:09:33,587
That's probably what they'll say.

144
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:35,629
I'd like that.

145
00:09:47,076 --> 00:09:47,872
Hey, gorgeous.

146
00:09:49,516 --> 00:09:52,155
Look, I'm sorry about yesterday.

147
00:09:52,396 --> 00:09:56,514
Don't worry about it. Apparently,
other people have made the same mistake.

148
00:09:57,716 --> 00:09:59,354
Okay. Phew!

149
00:10:02,076 --> 00:10:04,636
So what do you think it is about me?

150
00:10:05,756 --> 00:10:06,905
I don't know what.

151
00:10:07,116 --> 00:10:08,913
You just have. . .

152
00:10:09,116 --> 00:10:10,913
-. . .a quality.
-A quality. Great.

153
00:10:11,396 --> 00:10:14,945
It's a shame, because you and Lowell
would've made a great couple.

154
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:20,675
Lowell? Financial Services Lowell?
That's who you saw me with?

155
00:10:20,956 --> 00:10:21,991
What? He's cute.

156
00:10:22,236 --> 00:10:23,510
Well, yeah.

157
00:10:23,876 --> 00:10:25,832
He's no Brian in Payroll.

158
00:10:28,716 --> 00:10:29,705
Is Brian. . .?

159
00:10:29,956 --> 00:10:33,312
I don't know. The point is,
if you were gonna set me up. . .

160
00:10:33,516 --> 00:10:36,269
. . .I'd like to think it'd be
with somebody like him.

161
00:10:36,476 --> 00:10:38,865
I think Brian's
a little out of your league.

162
00:10:43,796 --> 00:10:47,550
Excuse me. You don't think
I could get a Brian?

163
00:10:50,396 --> 00:10:53,547
Because I could get a Brian.
Believe you me.

164
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,595
I'm really not.

165
00:10:57,796 --> 00:10:58,945
This one?

166
00:11:03,516 --> 00:11:05,632
I've shown you every dress we have.

167
00:11:05,876 --> 00:11:09,630
Unless you want her to spend eternity
in a lemon-yellow pantsuit. . .

168
00:11:09,876 --> 00:11:11,912
. . .go with the burgundy.

169
00:11:12,516 --> 00:11:15,713
Whatever we pick, she would've
told us it's the wrong one.

170
00:11:15,956 --> 00:11:18,026
You're right.
We'll go with the burgundy.

171
00:11:18,276 --> 00:11:20,915
A fine choice. I'm coming out.

172
00:11:21,116 --> 00:11:22,754
Wait! We need shoes.

173
00:11:30,996 --> 00:11:31,906
How about these?

174
00:11:32,596 --> 00:11:34,188
That's really a day shoe.

175
00:11:34,436 --> 00:11:37,394
And where she's going,
everyone else will be dressier?

176
00:11:38,796 --> 00:11:41,185
Could we see something
in a slimmer heel?

177
00:11:45,596 --> 00:11:49,714
I have nothing in an evening shoe
in the burgundy.

178
00:11:50,716 --> 00:11:53,310
I can show you something
in a silver that may work.

179
00:11:54,356 --> 00:11:56,392
No, it really should be burgundy.

180
00:11:56,756 --> 00:11:58,826
Unless we go with a different dress.

181
00:11:59,076 --> 00:12:00,953
No, no, no. Watch this.

182
00:12:01,196 --> 00:12:04,268
Wait, I may have something in the back.

183
00:12:16,516 --> 00:12:17,710
Oh, my God.

184
00:12:18,236 --> 00:12:19,794
Is everything all right?

185
00:12:22,596 --> 00:12:24,587
Just Nana's stuff.

186
00:12:42,476 --> 00:12:43,955
How we doing?
You guys ready?

187
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:46,835
Mom called to remind me
not to wear my hair up.

188
00:12:47,076 --> 00:12:49,306
Did you know my ears were not
my best feature?

189
00:12:49,556 --> 00:12:51,706
Some days it's all I can think about.

190
00:12:52,556 --> 00:12:55,434
Hi! I'm sorry I'm late.
I couldn't find my bearings.

191
00:12:55,996 --> 00:12:57,429
You mean your earrings?

192
00:12:57,996 --> 00:12:59,145
What did I say?

193
00:13:01,396 --> 00:13:04,468
-Are these the shoes?
-Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.

194
00:13:04,796 --> 00:13:07,629
What? We don't have shoes here?

195
00:13:09,756 --> 00:13:11,474
Morning. We ready to go?

196
00:13:11,716 --> 00:13:13,593
Don't we look nice all dressed up?

197
00:13:15,316 --> 00:13:17,432
It's stuff like that, isn't it?

198
00:13:28,876 --> 00:13:31,868
-It was a really beautiful service.
-It really was.

199
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:35,508
Come here, sweetheart.

200
00:13:38,836 --> 00:13:39,632
You know. . .

201
00:13:40,716 --> 00:13:43,514
. . .I think it's time for you
to start using night cream.

202
00:13:49,596 --> 00:13:50,392
What?

203
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:53,986
Nothing. Just your overcoat sounds
remarkably like Brent Musburger.

204
00:13:55,276 --> 00:13:57,631
Check it out. Giants-Cowboys.

205
00:13:58,676 --> 00:14:00,712
You're watching football at a funeral?

206
00:14:00,956 --> 00:14:04,505
No, it's the pregame.
I'm gonna watch it at the reception.

207
00:14:05,396 --> 00:14:07,705
You're a frightening, frightening man.

208
00:14:08,676 --> 00:14:11,748
Oh, no! My new Paolo shoes!

209
00:14:11,996 --> 00:14:13,714
I hope they're not ruined.

210
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,790
God, what a great day!

211
00:14:20,556 --> 00:14:22,547
What? Weatherwise.

212
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:25,269
I know.

213
00:14:25,876 --> 00:14:28,231
The air, the trees.

214
00:14:28,756 --> 00:14:32,715
Even though Nana's gone,
there's something almost life--

215
00:14:34,676 --> 00:14:36,507
Ross, are you okay?

216
00:14:36,756 --> 00:14:38,030
No, I'm fine.

217
00:14:39,236 --> 00:14:40,715
Just. . .

218
00:14:40,956 --> 00:14:43,231
. . .having my worst fear
realized, but. . . .

219
00:14:51,276 --> 00:14:54,188
I'm just checking to see
if the muscle's in spasm.

220
00:14:55,596 --> 00:14:58,235
-What? What is it?
-You missed a belt loop.

221
00:15:00,396 --> 00:15:02,432
Okay, it's in spasm.

222
00:15:03,516 --> 00:15:05,188
Here, sweetie. Here.

223
00:15:05,436 --> 00:15:07,472
I took these when I had
my golfing accident.

224
00:15:07,796 --> 00:15:08,672
Thanks, Mom.

225
00:15:16,796 --> 00:15:17,865
Sorry.

226
00:15:18,756 --> 00:15:20,235
Hi, I'm Andrea.

227
00:15:20,676 --> 00:15:22,507
I'm Dorothy's daughter.

228
00:15:22,716 --> 00:15:26,106
Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have
no idea who Dorothy is.

229
00:15:28,996 --> 00:15:30,475
Look who's up!

230
00:15:31,836 --> 00:15:32,666
How do you feel?

231
00:15:34,116 --> 00:15:35,435
I feel great.

232
00:15:36,996 --> 00:15:39,191
I feel great. I feel great.

233
00:15:40,716 --> 00:15:42,593
Wow, those pills really worked.

234
00:15:42,996 --> 00:15:45,749
Yeah. Not the first two,
but the second two. . . .

235
00:15:49,196 --> 00:15:50,788
I love you guys.

236
00:15:52,356 --> 00:15:55,632
You guys are the greatest.
I love my sister.

237
00:15:55,876 --> 00:15:57,992
I love Pheebs.

238
00:15:58,796 --> 00:16:00,070
That's so nice.

239
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:03,751
I love you, man.

240
00:16:05,516 --> 00:16:07,905
And listen,
if you wanna be gay, be gay!

241
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:12,628
It doesn't matter to me.

242
00:16:14,316 --> 00:16:15,305
You were right.

243
00:16:27,196 --> 00:16:30,074
I love you the most.

244
00:16:31,556 --> 00:16:34,912
Well, you know who I love the most?

245
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:37,545
You!

246
00:16:39,596 --> 00:16:41,507
Oh, you don't get it!

247
00:16:47,596 --> 00:16:48,915
What do you got there?

248
00:16:49,276 --> 00:16:52,188
Just a hearing disability.

249
00:16:53,276 --> 00:16:54,106
What's the score?

250
00:16:55,636 --> 00:16:58,628
1 7-1 4, Giants.
Three minutes to go in the third.

251
00:16:58,876 --> 00:16:59,865
Beautiful!

252
00:17:08,396 --> 00:17:11,706
Pheebs, could you maybe
hand me a cracker?

253
00:17:14,276 --> 00:17:16,107
Your grandmother would've hated this.

254
00:17:17,116 --> 00:17:19,949
Well, sure. What with it
being her funeral and all.

255
00:17:22,156 --> 00:17:24,351
No, I'd be hearing about. . .

256
00:17:24,596 --> 00:17:27,156
. . .why didn't I get
the honey-glazed ham.

257
00:17:27,396 --> 00:17:30,832
Or I didn't spend enough on flowers.
If I spent more, she'd say. . .

258
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:34,313
. . . ''Why waste your money?
I don't need flowers, I'm dead. ''

259
00:17:35,196 --> 00:17:36,834
That sounds like Nana.

260
00:17:38,276 --> 00:17:40,710
Do you know what it's like
to grow up. . .

261
00:17:41,276 --> 00:17:45,474
. . .with someone who is critical
of every single thing you say?

262
00:17:47,996 --> 00:17:49,111
I can imagine.

263
00:17:50,276 --> 00:17:53,029
I tell you, it's a wonder
your mother turned out. . .

264
00:17:53,276 --> 00:17:56,268
. . .to be the positive,
life-affirming person she is.

265
00:17:57,996 --> 00:17:59,907
That is a wonder!

266
00:18:02,396 --> 00:18:06,992
So tell me something, Mom.
If you had to do it all over again. . .

267
00:18:07,236 --> 00:18:10,148
. . .I mean, if she was here right now. . .

268
00:18:10,676 --> 00:18:11,825
. . .would you tell her?

269
00:18:12,596 --> 00:18:13,392
Tell her what?

270
00:18:14,796 --> 00:18:19,108
How she drove you crazy,
picking on every little detail.

271
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:21,313
Like your hair, for example.

272
00:18:22,116 --> 00:18:25,586
I'm not sure I know
what you're getting at.

273
00:18:26,996 --> 00:18:30,432
Would things have been better
if you'd just told her the truth?

274
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,311
I think some things are
better left unsaid.

275
00:18:39,556 --> 00:18:42,309
I think it's nicer when people
just get along.

276
00:18:46,316 --> 00:18:47,305
More wine?

277
00:18:47,756 --> 00:18:49,314
Oh, I think so.

278
00:18:57,196 --> 00:18:59,790
Those earrings look
really lovely on you.

279
00:19:01,956 --> 00:19:03,071
Thank you.

280
00:19:03,996 --> 00:19:05,065
They're yours.

281
00:19:05,996 --> 00:19:07,952
Actually, they were Nana's.

282
00:19:12,396 --> 00:19:14,114
Now I'm depressed!

283
00:19:18,396 --> 00:19:20,512
Even more than I was.

284
00:19:27,956 --> 00:19:29,912
Hey, who's this little naked guy?

285
00:19:30,116 --> 00:19:32,152
That little naked guy would be me.

286
00:19:33,796 --> 00:19:35,388
Look at the little thing!

287
00:19:38,116 --> 00:19:40,584
Yes, fine.
That is my penis.

288
00:19:41,356 --> 00:19:43,108
Can we be grownups now?

289
00:19:43,796 --> 00:19:45,149
Who are those people?

290
00:19:45,396 --> 00:19:46,192
Got me.

291
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:48,910
That's Nana right there in the middle.

292
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:51,071
Yeah, let's see.

293
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:53,876
''Me and the gang at Java Joe's. ''

294
00:19:54,076 --> 00:19:56,146
Monica, you look just like
your grandmother.

295
00:19:56,396 --> 00:19:57,511
How old was she there?

296
00:19:57,716 --> 00:19:59,547
Let's see, '' 1 939. ''

297
00:20:00,156 --> 00:20:01,714
Twenty-four, twenty-five.

298
00:20:02,996 --> 00:20:04,668
It looks like a fun gang.

299
00:20:10,316 --> 00:20:13,353
Look, look, look!
I got Monica naked!

300
00:20:13,556 --> 00:20:14,989
Let me see!

301
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:19,311
No, no. That would be me again.

302
00:20:23,996 --> 00:20:26,226
I'm just trying something.

303
00:20:37,116 --> 00:20:38,071
Hey, Lowell.

304
00:20:38,396 --> 00:20:39,670
Oh, hey, Chandler.

305
00:20:41,796 --> 00:20:44,151
So how's it going in
Financial Services?

306
00:20:44,396 --> 00:20:47,547
It's like Mardi gras without
the papier-mâché heads.

307
00:20:47,796 --> 00:20:48,831
How about you?

308
00:20:49,036 --> 00:20:50,913
Good. Good. Listen. . .

309
00:20:52,716 --> 00:20:55,708
. . .I don't know what Shelly told you
about me, but. . .

310
00:20:56,796 --> 00:20:58,115
. . .I'm not.

311
00:20:59,196 --> 00:21:01,312
I know. That's what I told her.

312
00:21:01,796 --> 00:21:02,911
Really?

313
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:05,868
So you can tell?

314
00:21:07,676 --> 00:21:11,874
Pretty much. Most of the time.
We have a kind of radar.

315
00:21:13,756 --> 00:21:15,553
So you don't think I have. . .

316
00:21:15,756 --> 00:21:16,586
. . .a quaIity?

317
00:21:17,396 --> 00:21:21,230
Speaking for my people,
I'd have to say no.

318
00:21:23,676 --> 00:21:26,793
By the way, your friend, Brian,
from Payroll? He is.

319
00:21:27,396 --> 00:21:28,351
He is?

320
00:21:28,556 --> 00:21:30,387
And way out of your league.

321
00:21:33,996 --> 00:21:35,509
Out of my league!

322
00:21:35,756 --> 00:21:39,715
I could get a Brian. If I wanted to
