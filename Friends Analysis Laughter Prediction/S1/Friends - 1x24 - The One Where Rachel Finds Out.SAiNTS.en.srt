1
00:00:04,371 --> 00:00:08,603
Oh, here's little Ben falling asleep.

2
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:13,438
A little bit later. Is he gonna sleep?

3
00:00:13,646 --> 00:00:18,481
Is he gonna sleep? Is he gonna?

4
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:21,515
Yep, out like a light!

5
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:25,346
This sure trumps
the "Has he pooped?" series.

6
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:27,389
Ross, we love him, okay?

7
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:30,654
But right now he's just
a little fat guy.

8
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,388
How excited can we get?

9
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:37,960
-What you got?
-400 pictures of Ben on a rug.

10
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:41,163
-Oh, my God!
-Let me see!

11
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:44,637
The One Where Rachel Finds Out

12
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,018
Here's little Ben nodding off.

13
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:32,953
Look at Aunt Monica's little boy!

14
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:36,925
-Look, he's got Ross haircut.
-Let me see.

15
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:40,390
Oh, God!
Is he just the sweetest thing?

16
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:43,898
You must just wanna kiss him all over.

17
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:49,940
That would be nice.

18
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:54,138
-Pardon?
-Nothing.

19
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:56,975
Just a little extra air in my mouth.

20
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:05,513
Chan, can you help me out?
I'll pay you back.

21
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:10,185
Right. Including the waffles
last week, you now owe me...

22
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:12,827
... 1 7 jillion dollars.

23
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,062
-Really, I'll pay you back this time.
-Where's this money coming from?

24
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:21,729
I'm helping out at the NYU
Med School with research.

25
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:23,568
What kind of research?

26
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:27,604
Just, you know, science.

27
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,941
Science.

28
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:34,376
Yeah, I think I've heard of that.

29
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:39,154
It's a fertility study.

30
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:44,689
Joey, please tell me you're only
donating your time.

31
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:49,060
Actually, a little more than that.

32
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:54,565
Thank you, God.
This will bring us so much joy.

33
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,670
Come on, it's not that big a deal.

34
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:00,437
I just go down there
every other day...

35
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:03,810
...and make my contribution
to the project.

36
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,781
But at the end of two weeks,
I get $700!

37
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:11,219
You're gonna be making money
hand over fist.

38
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:15,318
That's funny. Very funny.

39
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:21,300
This is great. I actually know
somebody who loves what they do.

40
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:27,566
But what do you do to unwind
after a tough day at work?

41
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:32,834
Okay, we got the coleslaw and buns.

42
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:37,449
The ground-up flesh
of formerly cute cows and turkeys.

43
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:41,654
I just love barbecuing with you.

44
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:44,413
Men are here!

45
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:51,086
We make fire.

46
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,723
Cook meat.

47
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:57,926
Put out fire by peeing,
no get invited back.

48
00:03:58,137 --> 00:03:59,502
Cute.

49
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:02,675
-Melanie called. She'll be late.
-Okay.

50
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:07,972
How are things going? Is she
becoming your "special someone"?

51
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:12,283
I don't know. She's pretty great.

52
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:16,251
What does she think of
your little science project?

53
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:21,356
You think I'd tell a girl I like
that I'm also seeing a cup?

54
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:25,954
Man's got a point.

55
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:29,861
The tough thing is,
she really wants to have sex.

56
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:31,969
Crazy bitch.

57
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:40,670
I got a week left to go.
According to the rules...

58
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:46,442
... I can't conduct personal
experiments, if you know what I mean.

59
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:50,316
Joey, we always know what you mean.

60
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:01,122
How long did you think
this barbecue would last?

61
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:05,929
-I'm going to China.
-Jeez, you say one thing, and....

62
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,666
-China?
-For the museum. Someone found a bone.

63
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:13,072
They don't want us to have it.

64
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:18,717
I'm going to try to persuade them.
It's a whole big bone thing.

65
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:21,318
Anyway, I'll be gone for a week.

66
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:26,823
If you want to reach me, you can't.
So here's my itinerary.

67
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:30,727
-Here's a picture of me.
-Oh, let me see.

68
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:36,293
Could you show it to Ben every now
and then so he doesn't forget me?

69
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:39,899
"Hi, Ben. I'm your father."

70
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,369
"I am The Head!"

71
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:52,751
This barbecue's gonna be very fun.

72
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:56,649
I wanted to wish Rachel
a happy birthday before I left.

73
00:05:56,856 --> 00:06:01,759
-She's out having drinks with Carl.
-Hey, who's Carl?

74
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,932
That guy she met at the coffeehouse.

75
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:11,695
-There's this guy she met at
-The coffeehouse? Right.

76
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:13,963
So you do know who he is.

77
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,244
I'll go say goodbye to the guys.

78
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:23,813
Hey, you know what?
Tell them that bone story.

79
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:34,156
-I have to go to China.
-The country?

80
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:39,665
No, this big pile of dishes
in my mom's breakfront.

81
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,195
Do you know who Carl is?

82
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:46,862
Let's see. Alvin, Simon, Theodore....
No.

83
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,937
Rachel's having
drinks with him tonight.

84
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:54,773
How can she, when she's never
shown interest in you?

85
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:58,109
-Forget about her.
-He's right.

86
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:01,286
Please move on. Go to China.
Eat Chinese food.

87
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:04,914
Of course, there
they just call it "food."

88
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:08,753
Yeah, I guess. I don't know.

89
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:12,589
All right, just give her this
for me, okay?

90
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:16,394
We're looking out for you.
We want you to be happy.

91
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:21,096
I may only have a couple beers
in me, but I love you.

92
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,876
I'm still on my first.

93
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:30,112
I just think you're nice.

94
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:40,623
That's when we started
this fruit basket business.

95
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:45,423
We call ourselves
"The Three Basketeers."

96
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:49,066
Like "The Three Musketeers,"
only with fruit.

97
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:58,343
-How do you want your burgers?
-Presents first!

98
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:01,342
We're doing presents first.

99
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:07,078
Hey, hold on there, tiger.
How are you holding up?

100
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:11,154
Well, not so good.
She thinks tonight we're gonna...

101
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:15,657
...complete the transaction,
if you know what And you do.

102
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:19,423
Have you ever thought about
being there for her?

103
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:21,764
What do you mean?

104
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:29,002
You know, just be there for her.

105
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:32,840
Not following you.

106
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,007
Think about it.

107
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:48,057
Okay. I'm guessing this is from....

108
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:54,157
-Thank you, Melanie.
-This one right here is from me.

109
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:59,270
Okay. It's light. It rattles.

110
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:00,494
It's...

111
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:04,539
...Travel Scrabble!

112
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:09,510
Thank you.

113
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,646
This one's from Joey.

114
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:19,655
It feels like a book, I think it's
a book. And it's a book!

115
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:21,759
It's Dr. Seuss!

116
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:26,456
That book got me through
some tough times.

117
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:29,661
There's a little child
inside this man.

118
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:33,566
The doctors say if they remove it,
he'll die.

119
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,834
-Who's this from?
-From Ross.

120
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:48,147
Oh, my God! He remembered!

121
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,284
-Remembered what?
-lt was months ago.

122
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:54,993
We walked by this antique store.
I saw this pin.

123
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:59,925
I told him it was like one
my grandma had when I was little.

124
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,691
I can't believe he remembered!

125
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:06,497
Well, sure, but can you
play it on a plane?

126
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:15,378
It's so pretty!
This must've cost him a fortune.

127
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:16,741
I can't believe it.

128
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,941
Remember when he
fell in love with Carol...

129
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:23,610
...and bought her that
expensive crystal duck?

130
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,354
What did you just say?

131
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:39,837
Crystal duck.

132
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:49,208
No, no, no. The "love" part?

133
00:10:55,488 --> 00:11:01,393
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, no, no, no.

134
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:07,357
That's good. Just keep rubbing
your head. That'll turn back time.

135
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:17,075
This is unbelievable.
I mean, this is unbelievable!

136
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:19,904
I know.
This is really, really huge.

137
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:24,572
No, it's not. It's small.
It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.

138
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:29,778
I don't think any of our lives
will ever be the same ever again.

139
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:33,753
Is there a mute button on this woman?

140
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:37,588
I think this is so great.
I mean, you and Ross!

141
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:40,766
-Did you have any idea?
-No, none!

142
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:44,834
My first night in the city,
he mentioned asking me out...

143
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,028
... but nothing ever happened.

144
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:50,402
What else did he say?
Does he wanna go out?

145
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:53,043
Given that he's in love with you...

146
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:56,646
... he wouldn't mind getting
a cup of coffee.

147
00:11:57,016 --> 00:12:02,044
Ross? All this time?
I've gotta talk to him.

148
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:05,223
-He's in China!
-The country.

149
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:09,927
Is his flight gone?

150
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:13,189
Yes! He's watching a woman do this:

151
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,388
He's gone!

152
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,296
His flight doesn't leave
for 45 minutes.

153
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:21,405
-What about time difference?
-From here to the airport?

154
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:25,168
-You'll never make it!
-I've gotta try.

155
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:27,368
What'll you say to him?

156
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,242
-I don't know.
-Then you shouldn't go.

157
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:34,112
Right. If you're gonna
break his heart, that can wait.

158
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,411
But if it's good, tell him now.

159
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:41,457
-Maybe I'll know when I see him.
-All right, does this help?

160
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:52,769
No. Look, all I know is, I cannot
wait a week. This is just too big.

161
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:57,068
I've just gotta talk to him.
Okay, I'll see you later.

162
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:00,939
Rachel, I love you!
Deal with me first!

163
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:14,481
All right.

164
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,496
-Ross! Excuse me, pardon me.
-Your boarding pass?

165
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:25,636
I need to talk to my friend.

166
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:29,774
Sorry, you're not allowed here
without a pass.

167
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:33,206
He's right there,
in the blue jacket! Can l?

168
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:35,380
I'm sorry. Federal regulations!

169
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:39,540
Then could you please
just give him a message for me?

170
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:43,811
-This is very important.
-All right. What's the message?

171
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,619
I don't know.

172
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:53,328
Excuse me, sir! Excuse me, sir?
I have a message for you.

173
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:57,866
Rachel loved the present.
She'll see you when you get back.

174
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,697
What?

175
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,801
Toby, I don't know
what she's talking about.

176
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:08,443
There's no Rachel.
Don't give me that deep freeze.

177
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:21,749
Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey!

178
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:25,556
I think I blacked out there
for a minute.

179
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,624
It was nothing.

180
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:32,827
Well, now we gotta
find something fun for you.

181
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:37,775
You know what?

182
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:43,341
Forget about me.
Let's give you another turn.

183
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:49,752
-Me, again?
-Sure. Why not?

184
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:58,354
Boy, somebody's gonna get
a big fruit basket tomorrow!

185
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:07,399
I gotta tell you, you are nothing like
I thought you'd be.

186
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:08,971
How do you mean?

187
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:13,611
I had you pegged as a guy
who's always, "Me, me, me!"

188
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:17,076
But you, you're a giver.

189
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:21,315
You're the most generous man
I ever met.

190
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,546
I mean, you're practically a woman.

191
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:35,729
-You're just saying that.
-No.

192
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:39,064
A woman!

193
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:52,281
-So?
-I missed him.

194
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:54,918
-I'm so sorry.
-That's too bad.

195
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,781
Yeah, right.

196
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,549
No, I feel bad for her. I do.

197
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:03,250
I can think of somebody
other than myself.

198
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,521
All right, I'm going to bed.

199
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:10,533
-Happy birthday. Hang in there.
-Thanks.

200
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:12,492
Yes!

201
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:16,238
Pizza coupons.

202
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:25,172
Okay. You guys want help
cleaning up this mess?

203
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:26,942
That'd be great.

204
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:33,486
So, Rach, you wanna save
this wrapping paper?

205
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:38,493
Are you gonna go for it with Ross
or should I throw it out?

206
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:45,326
I don't know. I don't know.

207
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:48,028
Thought about it
all the way there...

208
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,143
...and I thought about it all the way
back. You know, it's Ross!

209
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,745
You know what I mean? It's Ross.

210
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,677
-Sure!
-Sure.

211
00:16:57,883 --> 00:17:03,150
I don't know. This is just
my initial gut feeling...

212
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:07,716
... but I'm thinking
it'd be really great.

213
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:11,521
Oh, my God, me too!
We'd be like friends-in-law!

214
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,961
The best part is you already
know all about him.

215
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:18,295
You start on the 1 5th date.

216
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:21,905
But it would be like
starting on the 1 5th date.

217
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:24,708
Another good point.

218
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:29,142
I mean, on the 1 5th date,
you're already in a very...

219
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:32,579
... "relationship-y" place.
You're committed.

220
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:38,488
What happens if it doesn't work out?

221
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,659
-Why isn't it working out?
-Sometimes it doesn't.

222
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:45,625
Is he not cute enough?
Does he not make enough money?

223
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:48,800
-No, I'm just
-Maybe there's someone else.

224
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:53,665
-ls there someone else?
-No, there is no one else.

225
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:56,500
Then why are you dumping my brother?

226
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:09,915
Hey, big Spender!

227
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:14,416
She's still asleep.

228
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:19,356
-So how'd it go?
-You know how you think you're great?

229
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:23,592
The fact you'd even ask
shows how little you know me.

230
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:28,637
Last night I couldn't do the thing
that usually makes me great.

231
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:31,275
So I had to do all this other stuff.

232
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:34,275
And the response I got! Man, oh, man!

233
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:37,539
It was like a ticker-tape parade!

234
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:43,520
I know. My room's very, very close
to the parade route.

235
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:51,621
It was amazing, and not just for her.
For me too!

236
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:55,061
It's like, all of a sudden
I'm blind...

237
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:58,065
... but all my other senses
are heightened.

238
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:01,171
It's like I was able
to appreciate it...

239
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,464
...on another level.

240
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:10,981
-I didn't know you had another level.
-I know. Neither did l!

241
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,920
Is something going on with O.J.?

242
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,856
Hey, great skirt. Birthday present?

243
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:30,227
-From who?
-You.

244
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:33,131
I exchanged the blouse you got me.

245
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:35,965
Well, it's the thought.

246
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:41,177
Doesn't Ross'flight get in
in a couple hours? At gate 27B?

247
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:47,083
Yeah. Monica, you know, I've been
thinking about it.

248
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:50,584
I've decided this Ross thing
is not a good idea.

249
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:51,778
Why?

250
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:55,585
I feel like I wouldn't
just be going out with him.

251
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:59,594
I'd be going out with all of you.
There'd be pressure

252
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:01,628
No pressure, no pressure!

253
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:06,235
Nothing has happened,
and you're already so

254
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:10,397
I'm not "so." Okay, I was a teensy
bit weird at first...

255
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:13,737
... but I'll be good. I promise.

256
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,275
-Who is it?
-It's me, Carl.

257
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:24,385
-Come on up.
-Behind my brother's back?

258
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:31,321
Is the kind of crazy thing
you won't be hearing from me.

259
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:46,606
-Seven hundred bucks!
-All right, you did it!

260
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:49,110
Do we have any fruit?

261
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:53,283
Man, hell of a two weeks.

262
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:56,487
You know what?
I feel I learned something.

263
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:59,282
You'll stick with this
"all for her" thing?

264
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:01,116
What are you, crazy?

265
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:06,724
When a blind man gets his sight back,
does he walk around like this?

266
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:15,133
If I see one more picture
of Ed Begley Jr...

267
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:19,868
...in that stupid electric car,
I'm gonna shoot myself!

268
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:24,847
I'm not against
environmental issues, per se...

269
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,711
...it's just that guy!

270
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:31,145
I can't believe you'd rather
go out with him than me.

271
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,582
Excuse me, I'm trying
to have a date here.

272
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:38,154
Fine. Just stop thinking about me.

273
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:42,893
Can't do it, can you?

274
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:46,001
I'm thinking about you. So what?

275
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:49,401
I don't get it.
What do you see in this guy?

276
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:53,066
Happens to be a very nice guy.

277
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:56,406
I mean, come on, buddy!
Get a real car!

278
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:03,117
Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.

279
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,414
Ross, it's too hard.

280
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:10,323
Why, because it'll get weird
for everyone else? This is about us.

281
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:13,965
I've been in love with you
since the ninth grade.

282
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:18,965
You're like my best friend.
If we broke up, and I lost you

283
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,968
What makes you think that?

284
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:25,506
Have you been involved
where you haven't broken up?

285
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:28,568
No.

286
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:33,214
But it only has to happen once.

287
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:38,218
You and I both know we are perfect
for each other. Right?

288
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:42,792
So the only question is:
Are you attracted to me?

289
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:45,863
I don't know.

290
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:50,335
I mean, I've never looked at you
that way before.

291
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:52,730
Well, start looking.

292
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:05,673
-Wow.
-Exactly!

293
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:07,851
And I'm gonna be the guy...

294
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,351
...caught behind this hammerhead
in traffic!

295
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:16,254
Right! You're right.

296
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:18,153
You know what?

297
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:21,696
I'm supposed to pick up
a friend at the airport.

298
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:23,958
I am so sorry!

299
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:27,399
If you wanna finish your drinks,
please do.

300
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:31,098
-I'm sorry, I gotta go. I'm sorry.
-But....

301
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:39,349
-Where are you going?
-To get Ross.

302
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:41,917
-My God, this is so exciting!
-I know.

303
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:46,454
If you want the rest of my date,
I'm not gonna finish it.

304
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:52,454
-Rachel, he's not a sandwich.
-No, he's a banker with opera tickets.

305
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,596
Hello!

306
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,969
-Where you going?
-Airport.

307
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:04,539
You can't tell him.
There's so much I haven't done.

308
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:07,712
I haven't watched Baywatch
with Yasmine Bleeth!

309
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:13,283
Chandler, relax. This is a good
going to the airport.

310
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:17,516
Oh, well then fly, good woman,
fly like the wind.

311
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:20,691
-I'm flying!
-Tell him I'm the one who blew it!

312
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:26,927
Yes, another successful case
for the love doctor.

313
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,573
Excuse me! Pardon me.
Excuse me. Sorry.

314
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:42,472
Toby, for God's sake,
will you let it go?

315
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:44,214
There's no Rachel!

316
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:52,089
Hey! I got that.

317
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:54,785
-Thanks, sweetie.
-No problem.

318
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:03,462
I can't wait for you
to meet my friends.

319
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:06,364
You don't think they'll judge me?

320
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:09,335
-No, they will. I just....
-Can't wait!

321
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:12,032
Come on, they're gonna love you.

322
00:25:13,032 --> 00:25:23,032
