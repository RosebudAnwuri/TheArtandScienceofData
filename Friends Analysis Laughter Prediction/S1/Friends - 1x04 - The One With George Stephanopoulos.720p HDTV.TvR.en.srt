1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:03,380
All right, Phoebe?

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,860
If I were omnipotent for a day,
I would want world peace...

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,860
...no hunger, good things
for the rain forest.

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,780
And bigger boobs.

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,300
Well, see, you took mine.

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,300
What about you?

7
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:23,980
If I were omnipotent for a day,
I'd make myself omnipotent forever.

8
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,700
There's always one guy.

9
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:30,420
"lf I had a
wish, I'd wish for three more wishes. "

10
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,420
Hey, Joey.

11
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:35,140
What would you do
if you were omnipotent?

12
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,620
Probably kill myself.

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,820
Excuse me?

14
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:44,940
If little Joey's dead,
then I got no reason to live.

15
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:49,180
Joey, omnipotent.

16
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,140
You are?

17
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,100
Ross, l' m sorry. I had no idea. I
thought it was a theoretical question.

18
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,340
FRIENDS

19
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:44,841
How does she do that?

20
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,037
I can't sleep in a public place.

21
00:01:48,277 --> 00:01:49,516
Would you look at her?

22
00:01:49,756 --> 00:01:53,114
She is so peaceful.

23
00:01:54,234 --> 00:01:56,512
What? What? What?
Hi.

24
00:01:56,752 --> 00:01:59,551
It's okay. You just nodded off again.

25
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:00,830
What's going on?

26
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,349
I got no sleep last night.

27
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:06,147
My grandmother has a new boyfriend...

28
00:02:06,387 --> 00:02:09,465
and they' re both kind of insecure
in bed,

29
00:02:09,705 --> 00:02:12,663
so And deaf.

30
00:02:12,943 --> 00:02:16,661
They reassure each other
that they' re having a good time.

31
00:02:16,901 --> 00:02:20,379
You have no idea how loud they are.

32
00:02:20,858 --> 00:02:22,498
You can stay with Rachel and me.

33
00:02:22,737 --> 00:02:23,857
Gracias.

34
00:02:24,097 --> 00:02:26,055
- 95, 96, 97.

35
00:02:26,295 --> 00:02:30,093
See, I told you. Less than 100
steps
from our place to here.

36
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:33,451
You got way too much free time, man.

37
00:02:33,691 --> 00:02:36,130
There's the birthday boy.

38
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:37,169
Ross, check it out!

39
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:40,687
Hockey tickets. Rangers-Penguins
tonight and we're taking you

40
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:41,847
Happy birthday, pal!

41
00:02:42,086 --> 00:02:44,965
We love you, man.

42
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:48,203
It's funny.
My birthday
was seven months ago.

43
00:02:48,443 --> 00:02:50,681
So?
So you had an extra ticket...

44
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:54,319
and couldn't decide
who
got to bring a date?

45
00:02:54,559 --> 00:02:57,997
Well, aren't we
Mr. The-Glass-ls-Half-Empty?

46
00:02:58,237 --> 00:02:59,836
Oh, my God!

47
00:03:00,076 --> 00:03:01,915
Is today the 20th?
 October 20th?

48
00:03:02,155 --> 00:03:04,514
I hoped you wouldn't remember.

49
00:03:04,753 --> 00:03:06,073
What's wrong with the 20th?

50
00:03:06,313 --> 00:03:10,470
Eleven days before Halloween.
All the good costumes are gone?

51
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:14,108
Today's the day Carol and I first...

52
00:03:14,348 --> 00:03:16,427
...consummated our...

53
00:03:16,667 --> 00:03:19,785
... physical relationship.

54
00:03:20,025 --> 00:03:22,943
Sex.

55
00:03:24,222 --> 00:03:25,702
I better pass on the game.

56
00:03:25,941 --> 00:03:31,498
I'm just gonna go home and think about
my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.

57
00:03:31,738 --> 00:03:35,736
The hell with hockey!
Let's all do that!

58
00:03:36,136 --> 00:03:38,374
Come on, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice!

59
00:03:38,614 --> 00:03:42,252
Guys' night out!
Come on, what do you say, big guy?

60
00:03:42,492 --> 00:03:45,011
What are you doing?
I have no idea.

61
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,290
Come on, Ross.

62
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,168
Maybe it will take my mind off it.

63
00:03:49,408 --> 00:03:52,726
Promise to buy me a big foam finger?
You got it.

64
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:53,726
Look, look, look!

65
00:03:53,965 --> 00:03:55,405
My first paycheck!

66
00:03:55,645 --> 00:03:56,844
Look at the window!

67
00:03:57,084 --> 00:04:01,121
There's my name!
Hi, me!

68
00:04:01,281 --> 00:04:03,360
I remember when
I got my first paycheck.

69
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:08,197
There was a cave-in in a mine,
and eight people were killed.

70
00:04:08,717 --> 00:04:10,196
You worked in a mine?

71
00:04:10,436 --> 00:04:14,314
No, I worked at a Dairy Queen. Why?

72
00:04:16,113 --> 00:04:18,631
Isn't this exciting? I earned this.

73
00:04:18,871 --> 00:04:21,470
I wiped tables for it. I steamed milk.

74
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:23,549
And it was totally...

75
00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:25,867
... not worth it.

76
00:04:26,107 --> 00:04:30,225
What's FlCA?
Why's he getting all my money?

77
00:04:30,705 --> 00:04:34,303
I mean, what?
Chandler, look at that.

78
00:04:34,502 --> 00:04:36,261
This is not that bad.

79
00:04:36,501 --> 00:04:39,220
You're fine, yeah, for a first job.

80
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:43,497
You can totally,
totally live on this.

81
00:04:44,976 --> 00:04:47,335
By the way, great service today.

82
00:04:47,575 --> 00:04:50,253
- Incredible!
- Excelent!

83
00:04:52,012 --> 00:04:54,931
Hockey!

84
00:05:04,685 --> 00:05:07,484
Hockey!

85
00:05:08,523 --> 00:05:10,802
Rachel?

86
00:05:11,361 --> 00:05:13,960
Oh, my God!

87
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:22,235
I swear I've seen birds
do this on Wild Kingdom.

88
00:05:22,475 --> 00:05:24,154
What are you guys doing here?

89
00:05:24,394 --> 00:05:27,632
Well, we were in the city shopping,
and your mom said you work here,

90
00:05:27,872 --> 00:05:31,270
aaand it's true!

91
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:36,427
Look at you in the apron.
You look like you're in a play.

92
00:05:37,866 --> 00:05:41,184
Look at you, you are so big I can't believe it!

93
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:45,262
I know. I know! I'm a duplex.

94
00:05:45,302 --> 00:05:46,901
So what's going on with you?

95
00:05:47,141 --> 00:05:51,778
Well, guess who my dad's
making partner in his firm?

96
00:05:53,258 --> 00:05:57,255
And while we're on the subject of news..

97
00:05:59,094 --> 00:06:02,852
Look, look, I have elbows!

98
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,689
...Poulet passes it up to Leetch!

99
00:06:08,929 --> 00:06:13,246
Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass!

100
00:06:13,366 --> 00:06:17,404
We'll take a brief time out while Messier
stops to look at some women's shoes.

101
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:20,442
Carol was wearing boots just like those

102
00:06:20,682 --> 00:06:22,601
the night that we...

103
00:06:22,641 --> 00:06:23,960
we first- y'know.

104
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,599
Fact, she, uh... she never took'em off,

105
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:27,798
'cause we... we...

106
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:31,836
Sorry. Sorry.

107
00:06:35,673 --> 00:06:36,793
What?

108
00:06:37,033 --> 00:06:38,112
Peach pit.

109
00:06:38,352 --> 00:06:40,751
Yes, Bunny?

110
00:06:40,751 --> 00:06:41,790
Peach pit.

111
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,708
That night we, uh... we had...
Peaches?

112
00:06:44,948 --> 00:06:48,466
Actually, nectarines, but basically...

113
00:06:48,706 --> 00:06:51,265
Could've been a peach.

114
00:06:51,424 --> 00:06:53,263
Then, uh, then we got dressed,

115
00:06:53,503 --> 00:06:55,382
and I... I... I walked her to the...

116
00:06:55,622 --> 00:06:58,221
...the bus stop...

117
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,980
I'm fine.

118
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:03,777
Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's!

119
00:07:06,936 --> 00:07:10,534
What? Thought we were trying to find stuff.

120
00:07:10,773 --> 00:07:13,852
So c'mon, you guys,
tell me all the dirt!

121
00:07:14,092 --> 00:07:18,649
Well, the biggest news is still
you dumping Barry at the altar!

122
00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:22,767
Alright. Let's talk reality for a second.

123
00:07:23,007 --> 00:07:25,125
When are you coming home?
What?

124
00:07:25,365 --> 00:07:26,964
Guys, I'm not.

125
00:07:27,204 --> 00:07:29,363
C'mon, this is us.

126
00:07:29,603 --> 00:07:30,962
I'm not!

127
00:07:31,202 --> 00:07:34,520
This is what I'm doing now.
I've got this job...

128
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,479
Waitressing?

129
00:07:36,719 --> 00:07:39,277
Okay, I'm not just waitressing.
I'm.. I, um...

130
00:07:39,517 --> 00:07:42,395
I'm.. I, um...

131
00:07:43,995 --> 00:07:47,233
I write the specials on the specials board,

132
00:07:47,473 --> 00:07:52,110
I take the uh dead flowers
out of the vase...

133
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:56,348
Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put
the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies.

134
00:07:56,587 --> 00:08:00,785
Well. Your mom didn't tell
us about the blobbies.

135
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,418
Hey, Rach.
How was it with your friends?

136
00:08:16,136 --> 00:08:19,334
Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?

137
00:08:19,574 --> 00:08:20,734
What's that?

138
00:08:20,974 --> 00:08:24,571
Weeeell, it's rum, and...
Okay.

139
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:29,049
We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight
we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing.

140
00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:30,488
We got some trashy magazines,

141
00:08:30,728 --> 00:08:33,846
we got cookie dough, we got Twister...

142
00:08:34,086 --> 00:08:35,445
Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation!

143
00:08:35,685 --> 00:08:39,923
But, um, I lost the tweezers,
so we can't operate.

144
00:08:40,163 --> 00:08:43,561
But we can prep the guy!

145
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,399
Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card people.

146
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:48,678
Oh, God, ask them what they want.

147
00:08:48,918 --> 00:08:52,795
Could you please tell me
what this is in reference to?

148
00:08:53,035 --> 00:08:53,875
Yes, hold on.

149
00:08:54,115 --> 00:08:56,553
Um, they say there's been some
unusual activity on your account.

150
00:08:56,793 --> 00:08:58,992
But I haven't used my card in weeks!

151
00:08:59,232 --> 00:09:02,350
That is the unusual activity.

152
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,909
Look, they just wanna see if you're okay.

153
00:09:05,148 --> 00:09:06,907
They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay..

154
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:09,666
they wanna know if I'm okay,
okay, let's see.

155
00:09:09,906 --> 00:09:12,864
Well, let's see,
the FICA guys took all my money,

156
00:09:13,104 --> 00:09:15,822
everyone I know is either getting married,
or getting pregnant,

157
00:09:16,062 --> 00:09:18,261
or getting promoted,
and I'm getting coffee!

158
00:09:18,501 --> 00:09:20,500
And it's not even for me!

159
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:25,657
So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay,
then you can tell them I'm okay, okay?

160
00:09:27,256 --> 00:09:30,974
Uh... Rachel has left the building,

161
00:09:31,134 --> 00:09:32,013
can you call back?

162
00:09:32,253 --> 00:09:34,891
Alright, c'mon!

163
00:09:35,131 --> 00:09:38,729
Let's play Twister!

164
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:49,123
Sorry, sorry...
Uh... oh.

165
00:09:50,243 --> 00:09:52,801
What? There was ice
there that night with Carol?

166
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:57,599
Plastic seats?
Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?

167
00:09:57,838 --> 00:10:01,077
No, actually I was just saying it
looks like we're not sitting together.

168
00:10:01,316 --> 00:10:05,354
But now you mention it,
there was ice there that night...

169
00:10:05,594 --> 00:10:08,672
It was the first frost...

170
00:10:08,912 --> 00:10:10,791
C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit.

171
00:10:11,031 --> 00:10:14,469
You should feel great about yourself!
You're doing this amazing independence thing!

172
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:16,628
Monica, what is so amazing?

173
00:10:16,868 --> 00:10:21,065
I gave up, like, everything. And for what?

174
00:10:21,305 --> 00:10:23,184
You are just like Jack.

175
00:10:23,424 --> 00:10:25,023
...Jack from downstairs?

176
00:10:25,263 --> 00:10:28,341
No, Jack and the Beanstalk.

177
00:10:28,581 --> 00:10:30,940
Ah, the other Jack.

178
00:10:31,179 --> 00:10:32,499
Yeah, right! See, he gave up something,

179
00:10:32,739 --> 00:10:34,617
but then he got those magic beans.

180
00:10:34,857 --> 00:10:36,337
And then he woke up, and there was this,

181
00:10:36,576 --> 00:10:38,775
this big plant outside his window,

182
00:10:39,015 --> 00:10:42,253
full of possibilities and stuff...

183
00:10:42,493 --> 00:10:46,211
And he lived in a village,
and you live in the Village.

184
00:10:46,451 --> 00:10:49,809
Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up  a cow,

185
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:52,048
I gave up an orthodontist.

186
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:54,566
Okay, I... I... I know, I know I didn't love him...

187
00:10:54,806 --> 00:10:57,644
Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.

188
00:10:57,884 --> 00:11:00,603
But see, it was a plan.
Y'know, it was clear.

189
00:11:00,843 --> 00:11:03,841
It was figured out,
and now everything's just kinda like...

190
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:06,879
Floopy?

191
00:11:07,359 --> 00:11:10,117
So what, you're not the only one.
I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going.

192
00:11:10,357 --> 00:11:12,836
You've just gotta figure at some point
it's all gonna come together,

193
00:11:13,076 --> 00:11:15,714
and it's just gonna be... un-floopy.

194
00:11:15,954 --> 00:11:18,952
Oh, like that's a word.

195
00:11:20,671 --> 00:11:25,349
Okay, but Monica, what if... what if it
doesn't come together? ...Pheebs?

196
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:32,624
Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't like this question.

197
00:11:32,864 --> 00:11:36,182
Okay, see, see, you guys,
what if we don't get magic beans?

198
00:11:36,422 --> 00:11:38,941
I mean, what if all we've got are...

199
00:11:39,181 --> 00:11:42,259
...beans?

200
00:11:44,418 --> 00:11:45,497
Get him! GET HIM! Get him!

201
00:11:45,737 --> 00:11:47,576
Get- YESSS!

202
00:11:47,816 --> 00:11:50,774
Not laughing now, are ya pal!

203
00:11:51,014 --> 00:11:54,292
See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of
toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.

204
00:11:54,532 --> 00:11:56,771
Pass it!
Pass it!

205
00:11:57,011 --> 00:11:58,010
He's open!

206
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:01,208
Shoot! Shoot!
Shoot!

207
00:12:06,245 --> 00:12:09,244
Hey, look, we're on that TV thing!

208
00:12:23,036 --> 00:12:24,595
'Scuse me.

209
00:12:24,835 --> 00:12:30,432
It says to call this number if you're not
completely satisfied with this candy bar.

210
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:36,148
Well, I'm not completely satisfied.

211
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:37,867
Listen, it's kind of an emergency.

212
00:12:38,107 --> 00:12:41,905
Well, I guess you know that,
or we'd be in the predicament room.

213
00:12:43,344 --> 00:12:44,464
Hold on.

214
00:12:44,703 --> 00:12:46,462
Fill these out, sit over there.

215
00:12:46,702 --> 00:12:48,541
Look, I don't wanna make any trouble,
okay,

216
00:12:48,781 --> 00:12:53,019
but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright?
My face is dented.

217
00:12:53,259 --> 00:12:54,898
Well, you'll have to wait your turn.

218
00:12:55,138 --> 00:12:57,496
Well, how long do you think it'll be?

219
00:12:57,736 --> 00:13:01,214
Any minute now.

220
00:13:15,406 --> 00:13:19,644
I'm so sorry, you guys.
I didn't mean to bring you down.

221
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:22,082
No, you were right.

222
00:13:22,322 --> 00:13:25,800
I don't have a plan.

223
00:13:26,999 --> 00:13:28,119
Pizza guy!

224
00:13:28,359 --> 00:13:29,958
Thank God.
Food.

225
00:13:30,198 --> 00:13:32,236
Phoebe?
What?

226
00:13:32,476 --> 00:13:34,115
Do you have a plan?

227
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:37,593
I don't even have a 'pl'.

228
00:13:38,993 --> 00:13:42,631
Hi, one, uh, mushroom, green pepper and onion?

229
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,149
No, no, that's not what we ordered...

230
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:50,386
We ordered a fat-free
crust with extra cheese.

231
00:13:51,905 --> 00:13:54,264
Wait, you're not 'G.Stephanopoulos?'

232
00:13:54,504 --> 00:13:56,183
Man, my dad's gonna kill me!

233
00:13:56,423 --> 00:13:57,342
Wait!

234
00:13:57,582 --> 00:13:58,941
Did you say

235
00:13:59,181 --> 00:14:00,740
..."G.Stephanopoulos"?

236
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,539
Yeah. This one goes across the street,
I must have given him yours.

237
00:14:03,778 --> 00:14:06,217
Oh, bonehead, bonehead!

238
00:14:06,457 --> 00:14:11,734
Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean
guy with curiously intelligent good looks?

239
00:14:11,974 --> 00:14:13,333
Yeah, that sounds about right.

240
00:14:13,573 --> 00:14:15,932
Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?

241
00:14:16,171 --> 00:14:18,010
And... and a power tie?

242
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,009
No, pretty much just a towel.

243
00:14:20,249 --> 00:14:22,688
Oh God.

244
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:24,047
So you guys want me to take this back?

245
00:14:24,287 --> 00:14:29,444
Are you nuts?!
We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza!

246
00:14:34,121 --> 00:14:37,000
Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus?

247
00:14:38,119 --> 00:14:40,917
Big Bird's friend.

248
00:14:42,596 --> 00:14:43,516
I see pizza!

249
00:14:43,756 --> 00:14:45,715
Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see!

250
00:14:45,954 --> 00:14:47,833
Hello? Who are we spying on?

251
00:14:48,073 --> 00:14:51,072
White House adviser?
Clinton's campaign guy?

252
00:14:51,311 --> 00:14:54,510
 The one with the great hair,
sexy smile, really cute butt?

253
00:14:54,749 --> 00:14:59,187
Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him!

254
00:14:59,427 --> 00:15:01,706
Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman.

255
00:15:01,945 --> 00:15:03,864
Please tell me it's his mother.

256
00:15:04,104 --> 00:15:06,623
Definitely not his mother.
Oh, no...

257
00:15:06,863 --> 00:15:08,781
Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor...

258
00:15:09,021 --> 00:15:11,580
she's walking... she's walking...

259
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:16,737
she's going for the pizza...
Hey, that's not for you, bitch!

260
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:30,249
Excuse me,

261
00:15:30,489 --> 00:15:34,167
look, we've been here for over an hour,
and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in.

262
00:15:34,407 --> 00:15:38,964
I mean, that guy with the toe thing?
Who's he sleeping with?

263
00:15:40,643 --> 00:15:43,162
Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad...

264
00:15:43,402 --> 00:15:47,040
I know we both said some things

265
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,479
we didn't mean,

266
00:15:48,719 --> 00:15:51,997
but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other.

267
00:15:52,237 --> 00:15:56,234
Y'know, I feel like I've lost her...

268
00:15:58,593 --> 00:16:00,832
Light still out?

269
00:16:01,072 --> 00:16:03,191
Yeah.
Oh. Maybe they're... napping.

270
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,269
Oh please, they're having sex.

271
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:08,348
Shut up!

272
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:15,064
So, whaddya think George is like?

273
00:16:15,304 --> 00:16:17,862
I think he's shy.

274
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,181
Yeah. I think you have to draw him out.

275
00:16:20,421 --> 00:16:21,900
And then... when you do...

276
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:25,698
he's a preppy animal.

277
00:16:28,896 --> 00:16:30,855
I remember the moonlight
coming through the window...

278
00:16:31,095 --> 00:16:33,933
and her face had the most

279
00:16:34,173 --> 00:16:35,452
 incredible glow.

280
00:16:35,692 --> 00:16:38,850
Yes, the moon, the glow,
the magical feeling,

281
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:43,408
you did this part... Could I get some
painkillers over here, please?

282
00:16:43,647 --> 00:16:47,126
He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today?

283
00:16:47,365 --> 00:16:49,124
So you slept with her for
the first time, so what?

284
00:16:49,364 --> 00:16:53,642
You slept with her for
seven years after that.

285
00:16:53,882 --> 00:16:56,040
Look, it's just a little
more complicated...

286
00:16:56,065 --> 00:16:56,479
Well, what? What? What is it?

287
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,118
That she left you? That she likes women?
That she left you for another woman that likes women?

288
00:17:01,158 --> 00:17:06,794
Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the
twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you...

289
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,712
Then what?

290
00:17:10,952 --> 00:17:13,550
My first time with Carol

291
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:16,469
was...

292
00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:19,707
What?

293
00:17:20,626 --> 00:17:23,225
It was my first...

294
00:17:23,465 --> 00:17:25,584
time.

295
00:17:25,823 --> 00:17:28,142
With Carol?

296
00:17:34,139 --> 00:17:38,856
So in your whole life,
you've only been with one...

297
00:17:39,056 --> 00:17:43,094
Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake!

298
00:17:43,334 --> 00:17:47,011
There was a whole bunch of stuff
we could've done tonight!

299
00:17:48,171 --> 00:17:50,410
Okay. Okay, I got one.

300
00:17:50,649 --> 00:17:53,408
Do you remember that vegetarian pate

301
00:17:53,648 --> 00:17:57,645
that I made that you loved so much?

302
00:17:57,645 --> 00:18:02,043
Well, unless goose is a vegetable...
ha haaaah!

303
00:18:04,162 --> 00:18:08,359
Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley.

304
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:10,438
What?! You slept with Jason?

305
00:18:10,678 --> 00:18:12,117
You'd already broken up.

306
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:13,556
How long?

307
00:18:13,796 --> 00:18:14,756
A couple hours.

308
00:18:14,996 --> 00:18:16,755
Oh, that's nice!

309
00:18:16,994 --> 00:18:20,432
Okay, okay, okay, I got one!

310
00:18:21,312 --> 00:18:22,191
Anyway...

311
00:18:22,431 --> 00:18:26,389
The valentine Tommy Rollerson
left in your locker was really from me.

312
00:18:26,629 --> 00:18:28,388
Excuse me?!

313
00:18:28,628 --> 00:18:33,265
Hello? Like he was really
gonna send you one?

314
00:18:34,145 --> 00:18:37,663
She was a big girl.

315
00:18:38,022 --> 00:18:40,461
Really. Well, at least 'big girls'

316
00:18:40,701 --> 00:18:43,939
don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!

317
00:18:44,179 --> 00:18:46,777
I was laughing! You made me laugh!
There he is! There he is!

318
00:18:47,017 --> 00:18:49,456
Where?

319
00:18:49,696 --> 00:18:52,934
Right... where we've been looking all night!

320
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:56,092
He is so cute!
Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!

321
00:18:56,332 --> 00:18:59,610
Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel!
Please drop the…

322
00:19:05,407 --> 00:19:10,884
Man. Can you believe he's
only had sex with one woman?

323
00:19:11,124 --> 00:19:12,563
I think it's great.

324
00:19:12,803 --> 00:19:14,762
Y'know, it's sweet,

325
00:19:15,001 --> 00:19:17,680
it's romantic...

326
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,719
Really?

327
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:22,157
No, you kidding? The guy's a freak...

328
00:19:22,397 --> 00:19:25,395
Hey, buddy.

329
00:19:29,353 --> 00:19:32,431
Hi.
Oh, that's attractive.

330
00:19:32,951 --> 00:19:37,189
Oh, I thought you were
great in Silence of the Lambs.

331
00:19:38,188 --> 00:19:41,306
Oh come on, admit it!
All things considered, you had fun tonight.

332
00:19:41,546 --> 00:19:45,184
Fun? Where was the fun?
Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part?

333
00:19:45,424 --> 00:19:47,263
Where's my puck?

334
00:19:47,503 --> 00:19:50,461
Oh, ah... the kid has it.
The kid...?

335
00:19:50,701 --> 00:19:53,140
Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck.

336
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:58,297
I found it.
Finders keepers, losers weepers.

337
00:20:00,176 --> 00:20:02,854
You gotta do it, man.

338
00:20:03,094 --> 00:20:05,892
Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber,
you're glue, whatever...

339
00:20:06,132 --> 00:20:07,931
can't do it.

340
00:20:08,171 --> 00:20:11,129
Listen, uh... gimme back my puck.

341
00:20:11,369 --> 00:20:12,289
Sí, claro que sí.

342
00:20:12,529 --> 00:20:14,727
'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme!
No! No!

343
00:20:14,967 --> 00:20:16,526
Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER!

344
00:20:16,766 --> 00:20:19,605
GIVE ME MY PUCK!!

345
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:26,761
Now that was fun.

346
00:20:33,757 --> 00:20:36,315
Okay, Right foot red.

347
00:20:36,555 --> 00:20:40,952
Could've played Monopoly,
 but nooooo.

348
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:48,348
Thanks.

349
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:57,183
Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue.

350
00:20:58,343 --> 00:21:01,141
Good.

351
00:21:07,138 --> 00:21:08,977
Hello?
Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card people.

352
00:21:09,216 --> 00:21:10,775
Oh, okay. Will you take my place?

353
00:21:11,015 --> 00:21:14,293
Alright.
Yes, this is Rachel.

354
00:21:17,931 --> 00:21:21,449
Hello? Oh, yeah, no, I know,
I... I haven't been using it much.

355
00:21:21,689 --> 00:21:25,127
Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really.

356
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,766
Green. To the green.

357
00:21:28,006 --> 00:21:31,524
I've got magic beans.

358
00:21:32,483 --> 00:21:33,882
Never... never mind.

359
00:21:34,122 --> 00:21:37,121
To the left, to the left... aww!

360
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,118
Ohhh... I'm fine.
